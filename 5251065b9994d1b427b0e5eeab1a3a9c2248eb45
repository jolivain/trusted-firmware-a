I see that we don\u0027t have many status properties in the regulators nodes.\nSo can you say what this particular problem / which device this fixes?\nI\u0027d say we are saved by the fact the we only support a subset of regulators, in fact only those for which I can\u0027t find a status property in the mainline DTs.",

      "message": "Well, the situation that prompted me to submit this PR was that I received a batch of assembled PCBs of which all have DLDO3 shorted to GND. Disabling its node via the \u0027status\u0027 property was the very first idea of how to remedy this situation that came to my mind, as it\u0027s a very well-established convention both in Linux and U-boot (and an omission to check it is considered a bug there).\nAbsence of the \u0027status\u0027 property indicates an enabled node, thus nodes without it get exactly the same treatment as they did before the property became recognized.",

      "message": "I see, thanks. I was just scratching my head about it, because I didn\u0027t see any difference given the mainline DTs I looked at (as we barely have status properties in the regulator nodes at all).\nSo can you please mention this in the commit message? At the moment the message reads more like it would limit the number of pointlessly activated regulators (which isn\u0027t really the case, given the existing DTs), but it is really about *preventing disabled* regulators from being enabled and causing harm (which is subtly different).\nThanks!",
