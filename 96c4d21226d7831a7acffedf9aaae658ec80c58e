      "message": "Quite a lot of build failures because of usage of llx/lld, replacing all the occurrence of these will be a lot of work.\n\nBTW, i am trying understand your motive behind this change. Looking at earlier comments it appears that the reason for this change was\n1) Code is not portable.  Code with printf format specifiers for 64_t types will not recompile when ported to/from ATF.\n2) Static analysis tools get confused.  We get parse errors when running coverity scan analysis on ATF due to a different type of stdint type for uint64_t.\n\nWhere do you want to port it. TF-A code is meant for Arm (32/64 bit) and its working perfectly fine.\nAlso, https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0024/a/Porting-to-A64/Data-types does not mentions about not using long long for Aarch64.\n\nRegarding coverity scan, we also use it in our CI, it would be interesting to look at the errors you are mentioning.\n",

      "message": "So Manish and I had a quick chat about this patch, and I think we\u0027ve come to a conclusion:\n\n- According to the ABI, `long` is 32-bits and `long long` is 64 bits in both A32 and A64 [1], so we can\u0027t switch out `uint64_t` for `unsigned long`. I\u0027ve verified that this is the case on GCC.\n- The rest of the patch introducing the printf specifiers makes sense, and is probably necessary for us to comply with the language standard.\n- In the longer term we ought to consider using the freestanding standard library headers provided by the compiler to avoid issues like this in the future.\n\nI think it makes sense to take this change, but we just need to undo the change to the 64-bit datatypes first.\n\n[1]: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0024/a/Porting-to-A64/Data-types",

      "message": "Hm, you\u0027re right. It looks like my quick experiment probably used the wrong GCC, because Arm64 does use 64-bit long [1]. GCC also defines `__UINT64_TYPE__` to be `unsigned long` and not `unsigned long long` [2], so it does seem that using ULL violates GCC\u0027s (and probably Clang\u0027s and ArmClang\u0027s as a result as well) expectations about the size of the fixed-width types.\n\nBoth GCC and Clang define `__[U]INT[N]_TYPE__` and `__\u003cT\u003e_FMT\u003cs\u003e__`, so maybe rather than trying to guess the correct primitive types explicitly we should just use these in our fixed-width typedefs and printf specifiers?\n\nEither way, to merge this we\u0027ll need to clean up the build failures caused by downsizing U64 - it looks like some of these are sign errors (I\u0027m not sure how these ever passed the CI, nor why they\u0027re not picked up by static analysis), but some of them are due to the change in size.\n\n\u003e Perhaps I should introduce that inttypes.h first and then have the stdint.h change in a follow on commit?\n\nI think this makes sense to do to keep these two changes isolated.\n\n[1]: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/xz4asvx9b\n[2]: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/7oY6KT8eK",
