      "message": "That\u0027s a very good point. Not even I see the output (hence this patch in the first place), because this is hidden somewhere deep in the CI. I just try to reason about Alexei\u0027s comments and hope for the best ;-)\n\nAnd it would be good to bring this problem up: there should be a publicly accessible way to do the MISRA checks or get access to the results.\nMaybe MISRA could be a gerrit reviewer, formatting its complaints into gerrit review comments? Or we provide some ways to push a file somewhere and get a result back?",
