      "message": "GPT image gets loaded without authentication in TF-A code. This image only contains partition information that gets retrieved on request in the code [1]. Only MBR boot signature verification of GPT image gets done as an integrity check.\n\n[1]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/drivers/partition/partition.c#n253\n\nIMO, the GPT image should also get removed from this list as its hash is not get calculated in code flow (means it does not get measured). Let me know what do you think?",

      "message": "Yes, I think you\u0027re right. GPT is a container, just like FIP is. We don\u0027t measure the FIP but rather the images inside it. It would seem logical to treat GPT the same way.\n\nBesides, only images that get loaded through load_auth_image() get measured right now. As you pointed out, the GPT does not get loaded through load_auth_image() but rather through partition_init().",
