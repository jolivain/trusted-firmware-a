Only MBR boot signature verification of GPT image gets done as an integrity check.\n\n[1]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/drivers/partition/partition.c#n253\n\nIMO, the GPT image should also get removed from this list as its hash is not get calculated in code flow (means it does not get measured). Let me know what do you think?",
