      "message": "With this patch, arm_execution_state_switch() will never be called on AArch32. It\u0027s currently defined in plat/arm/common/execution_state_switch.c, which contains just this single function. Hence, I wonder whether we should simply exclude execution_state_switch.c from the platform makefile on AArch32, and make it an AArch64-only file. We\u0027d probably need to move it into plat/arm/common/aarch64 in this case and we could remove the #if __aarch64 in the code.\n\nDoes it make sense?",
