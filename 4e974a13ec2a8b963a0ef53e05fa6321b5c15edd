      "message": "Hi Soby, just to clarify, what would be the purpose of NEED_RMM flag? I see that setting it as yes or no with external RMM doesn\u0027t make a difference as ENABLE_RME would already include rmmd makefile.\n\nRDV3 had this flag set as \"no\" along with RMM set to an external path. Would like to clarify if NEED_RMM is something we shouldn\u0027t be setting from platform itself?",
