      "message": "Hi Soby, just to clarify, what would be the purpose of NEED_RMM flag? I see that setting it as yes or no with external RMM doesn\u0027t make a difference as ENABLE_RME would already include rmmd makefile.\n\nRDV3 had this flag set as \"no\" along with RMM set to an external path. Would like to clarify if NEED_RMM is something we shouldn\u0027t be setting from platform itself?",

      "message": "Intention was to make sure that --rmm-fw gets added to relevant tools anytime RME support is enabled. 2 questions:\n\n1. We can have NEED_RMM set to yes within RDV3 or maybe remove that option itself from our platform makefile to have this work. However was this intended to be set to yes for external RMM as well?\n\n2. If NEED_RMM should always be yes for ENABLE_RME, wouldn\u0027t ENABLE_RME alone serve the purpose?",
