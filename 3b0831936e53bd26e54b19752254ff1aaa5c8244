      "message": "I think that, given the fact that the state is not preserved during suspend, we can keep the context save/restore for pmblimitr_el1. \n\nNow, it is not clear to me why we are having this behavior (not getting the state preserved). This is what is in the ARM-ARM:\n\n----\nStandby\n(...)\nThe **PE preserves the PE state**, including the debug logic state. Changing from standby to normal operation does not involve a reset of the PE. \n\nRetention\nThe OS takes some measures, including IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED code sequences and registers, to reduce energy consumption. **The PE state, including debug settings, is preserved in low-power structures**, allowing the Core power domain to be at least partially turned off.\n\n----\n\n\nFor Standby, it is very straightforward, but for Retention, it doesn\u0027t explicitly say who saves the PE state in low-power structures (HW vs SW). Also, not sure of which one of the states the FVP switches to in your tests.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. I am OK to give my vote to the patch as it is anyway.",
