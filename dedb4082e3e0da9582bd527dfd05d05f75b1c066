      "message": "Hi Okash, Sorry for not replying on email I was waiting on some information from the Arm Partner team. \n\nThey have requested that these file be named \"cortex_x1_cxc_google\" as I understand the MIDR would have been issued under the “CXC” (Cortex-X Custom) program to Google. Other partners can have their own MIDR for Cortex X1 hence the file naming to make clear.\n\nI\u0027m still waiting confirmation from them that the MIDR you quoted is the one allocated to Google\u0027s license but not heard back on that yet. I\u0027m sure it will be as you are quoting it.\n\nThanks Joanna\n\n\n\n",

Other fields (architecture, part number, variant and revision) should be agnostic of licensee, right?\n\nBest regards,\nOkash",

      "message": "Hi Joanna,\n\nSince it\u0027s only the MIDR that\u0027s different, would it make sense to rename the MIDR macro `CORTEX_X1_MIDR` to be `CORTEX_X1_CXC_GOOGLE_MIDR` while keep the rest of the code same? Changing file names means we also change symbol names such as reset function, power down function and errata workaround handlers to contain *_cxc_google suffix, while all those functions apply to Cortex-X1 in general and are not specific to cxc_google. This way we can extend this same code to include any other CXC by adding one more MIDR and updating `declare_cpu_ops` accordingly, instead of having to duplicate the code and all the errata workarounds.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nThanks,\nOkash",
