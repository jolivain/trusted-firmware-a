      "message": "Hi Yann,\n\nSorry I am coming late to the review but I wondered... What\u0027s the plan for existing uses of __unused? Are we going to move the whole TF-A codebase away from __unused in favour of __maybe_unused where that makes sense? I also notice the Linux kernel also has __always_unused, any plans to introduce this one too?",

      "message": "Hi Sandrine,\n\nI put some of my concerns in a comment on patch: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/16429\n\nMy idea was to use __maybe_unused for all new patches to avoid those checkpatch errors. But I had no plan to change the existing code. Maybe it should?\n\nI didn\u0027t plan anything for __always_unused. But it may be clearer for e.g. function parameters that are not used inside the function. What\u0027s your opinion?",

      "message": "Sorry Yann, somehow I did not receive any email notification for your answer and so I missed it...\n\nI am between 2 minds about __always_unused, or even __maybe_unused for that matter. On one hand, they self-document the code, which is good. On the other hand, they are purely informational, as they both map to __unused so this has no meaning for the compiler. This means we could have occurences of __always_unused variables that in fact are used in some cases. This could easily happen as interfaces evolve over time (but we forget to update __always_unused into __maybe_unused), or just because the variable is used in a very specific build configuration that is not obvious. So in this case, the self-documentation value goes away, worse it becomes misleading!\n\nTBH my preference would have been not to introduce __maybe_unused in the first place and instead find a way to silent checkpatch.pl by declaring TF-A does not want to enforce this. But I don\u0027t know how easy that would be...",
