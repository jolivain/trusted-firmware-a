      "message": "I see the changelog has followed the structure of the previous changelog and I do think over recent releases the changelog has lost some of the more fuller descriptive nature of the v1.x releases. However rather than request changes this release as we followed the current format in the previous release and for the next we will be able to build something from the conventional commits lets look at revisiting how the Changelog is structured then by allocating more time before the release to agree a possible change in structure and format of the Changelog.",
