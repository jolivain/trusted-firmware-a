Will fix this ASAP.\n(In a nutshell: this function is per frame, so if your platform has multiple GICR ranges, the caller would need to iterate (and add) anyway. Also: We assume that each region is contiguous when it cames to GICR_TYPER accessibility, as this is what the Linux kernel does as well).",
