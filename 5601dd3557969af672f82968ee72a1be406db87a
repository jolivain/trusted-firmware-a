We really want to see that before maintainers engage in reviewing.\n\nI\u0027ve kicked off a CI run on the top of the patch stack and I can provide some guidance this page will show your results.  http://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-gerrit-tforg-l2/332/ We can get false positives but I can help clarify if you have queries.
