      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s quite possible that such a change should be effected.\n\nShould I squash it then?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWell, I also considered that actually, but the earlier changes did not add new code, they just moved stuff around; if I understand correctly, this does not constitute new copyright, hence the lack of such a change.\n\nConversely, copyright does not need to be declared for it to still be valid (it\u0027s automatic under the berne convention).\n\nSo it\u0027s really a matter of style whether to squash it, or leave it as a new commit as-is.",
