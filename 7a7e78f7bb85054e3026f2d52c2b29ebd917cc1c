What happens if, for example, we ran:\n\n    $(if $(call which,clang),X,Y)\n\nIf `clang` is not on the path, on Linux that would resolve to X, but on Windows that would always resolve to Y, because the result of the call to `which` would be `\"\"`.\n\nI think maybe we instead need to wrap the programs we call in quotes at the call site.",
