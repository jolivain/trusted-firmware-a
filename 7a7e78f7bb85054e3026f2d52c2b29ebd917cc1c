      "message": "I\u0027m wondering if this might have a broader, harder-to-debug impact on other parts of the build system. What happens if, for example, we ran:\n\n    $(if $(call which,clang),X,Y)\n\nIf `clang` is not on the path, on Linux that would resolve to X, but on Windows that would always resolve to Y, because the result of the call to `which` would be `\"\"`.\n\nI think maybe we instead need to wrap the programs we call in quotes at the call site.",

      "message": "I have some concerns about wrapping the program in the quotes at the call site. Mainly that we would be setting a hard to follow convention i.e. how would a developer know when the quotes are needed to call a program? I think the cleaner, more transparent solution might be to wrap the return value of `canonicalize-toolchain-tool-path` in quotes. This means anyone dealing with toolchains has a predictable way of handling them.",
