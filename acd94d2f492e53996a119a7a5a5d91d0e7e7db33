      "message": "Hi Demi Marie,\n\nThank you for the patch!\n\nI agree that this will fix the immediate issue at hand so let\u0027s get this merged.\n\nHowever, going forward I think we should store the hash length alongside the hash data we retrieve from the certificate (*). In the commit message, you hinted that this turned out to be quite difficult... Could you please elaborate?\n\n(*) And likewise we should store the key length alongside the key material for AUTH_PARAM_PUB_KEY types of parameters.",
