      "message": "I have a very limited understanding of mbedTLS project and the cryptographic algorithms. Please take my comments with a pinch of salt. \nAs seen here https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/blob/mbedtls-2.18.0/include/mbedtls/md.h#L74, MBEDTLS_MD_MAX_SIZE is 32 for any hash algorithm other than sha512. Hence for sha384, MBEDTLS_MD_MAX_SIZE is 32 but TCG_DIGEST_SIZE is 48. Is it intentional?",
