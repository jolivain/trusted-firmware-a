And the gpt.h header would be a consumer of those basic efi declarations.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I would rather have efi.h:\n\u003e +include \u003ctools_share/uuid.h\u003e\n\u003e +#define GUID_LEN  sizeof(efi_uuid)\n\u003e \n\u003e  and gpt.h\n\u003e +include \u003ctools_share/uuid.h\u003e\n\u003e +#define GUID_LEN  sizeof(uuid)\n\nThis has the GUID_LEN getting defined in both files. That can again cause redefinition errors when we need both the header files. Can we not have the macro defined in a single header, and then have that header included by other consumers of that macro.",
