      "message": "I noticed that BL1 linker script had a dot here to force the stacks position. We will lose it with the STACK_SECTION macro. I am worried that it might serve a specific purpose. Apparently I added it on purpose in the following patch a while ago: https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/101/commits/4f59d8359f97e031c212032afeb57124ac4fcd94 I can\u0027t recall the exact reason and the commit message does not help much...\n\nDid you notice any difference in the stacks position for BL1 with this patch?",
