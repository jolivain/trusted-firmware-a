      "message": "I see what you have done. I guess the question is how of this is generic and how much is pltform specific.\n\nThe functionality of debugFS is generic, which is why the debugfs fns are a lib.\n\nNow the SMC is in ARM SiP range whereas the build option is Generic (As it doesn\u0027t have ARM_ prefix to indicate it is SiP specific). So enabling the build flag doesn\u0027t do anything for a non-ARM SiP platform.\n\nIdeally we would like to make this SMC as generic as possible which means it shouldn\u0027t be SiP specific. We need to discuss regarding how to expose SMC.",
