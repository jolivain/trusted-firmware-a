      "message": "\"automatically\" can be ambiguous here. I would suggest changing this word to \"statically\" or \"forcibly\".\n\nIt is good to see we now have the FEAT_STATE_CHECK support on the code side. It feels like we should have this on the Make side as well. (It would be a lot clearer if we could set this to FEAT_STATE_CHECK instead of 2.)\n\nDo we already enable FEATURE_DETECTION? Is that an unrelated flag?",
