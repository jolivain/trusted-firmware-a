I\u0027ve skimmed https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_configure_TF-A_FIP#Updating_the_FIP_binary and trying to understand the use case:\n\n- So the FIP image would contain the SSBL as well, right?\n- Can you still fit FIP image into eMMC boot partition?",

      "message": "Hi Vyacheslav,\n\nThe FIP image contains SSBL (and its device tree) and BL32: either TF-A SP_min  (and its device tree) or OP-TEE.\nThe FIP file is usually between 1MB and 1.5MB, and BL2 ~220kB. So if your eMMC boot partition is 2MB, it should be OK. This is what we have on STM32MP157C-EV1 board.\nMaybe it is possible with a 1MB boot partition size with some optimizations.",
