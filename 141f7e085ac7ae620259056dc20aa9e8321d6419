      "message": "should we indicate ws1 and ws0 in the names? Also do we really reset the system on a ws0 trusted watch dog? Typically, when there is trusted ws0 to EL3, we simply reset the ws0 watchdog and keep running, similar to how say linux handles non-secure ws0.. not sure i understand why we reset the system on secure/trusted ws0.",

      "message": "Thanks. I have been thinking the same but could not define what should be default behavior.\nIf the default behavior can differ or can not be enforced then that would motivate to have separate handlers for both.\n\nPrimary goal of watchdog is to *recover* and reset is the ultimate option.\n\n  Secure watchdog WS0 might not mean a terminal error condition. While that is platform specific we must give option to bailout without resetting the platform by the default handler. ie. platform may take some action to recover and might want default handler to skip the reset. In that case how do I skip the reset at default handler. Let me think.\n\nI don\u0027t want to fully override the handlers by platforms as I think there will be more generic set of actions in future within this default handlers which platforms can benefit.",
