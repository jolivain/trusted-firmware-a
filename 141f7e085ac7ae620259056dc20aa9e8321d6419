Typically, when there is trusted ws0 to EL3, we simply reset the ws0 watchdog and keep running, similar to how say linux handles non-secure ws0.. not sure i understand why we reset the system on secure/trusted ws0.",

      "message": "Thanks. I have been thinking the same but could not define what should be default behavior.\nIf the default behavior can differ or can not be enforced then that would motivate to have separate handlers for both.\n\nPrimary goal of watchdog is to *recover* and reset is the ultimate option.\n\n  Secure watchdog WS0 might not mean a terminal error condition. While that is platform specific we must give option to bailout without resetting the platform by the default handler. ie. platform may take some action to recover and might want default handler to skip the reset. In that case how do I skip the reset at default handler. Let me think.\n\nI don\u0027t want to fully override the handlers by platforms as I think there will be more generic set of actions in future within this default handlers which platforms can benefit.",

      "message": "I wanted to see if we can define a default behavior for these conditions.\n\nNTWDG WS0 (EL1/2) -  linux does a panic then optionally crashdump and reset. I have seen platforms using watchdog ISR to know the component is alive but I think the former is a proper usage. ie. detect a lockup and if possible give more information about it.\n\nNTWDG WS1 (EL3) -  I think we can do reset as default behavior like in this handler.\n\nTWDGWS0 (EL3) -  I think panic() can be a default behavior instead of reset2().\nLet platform completely override as of now.\n\nAnd as side discussion about the usage of TWDGWS0, If we refresh the watchdog in this G0_EL3 ISR it is not going to detect any hang in S_EL1/S_EL2. And if its stuck in EL3 then anyway no interrupts can come. Correct me if I am missing something. So I think instead of reloading in WS0 we should reload in some other low prio context whose hang we intend to detect. And this interrupt will give opportunity to collect more information about that hang.",

      "message": "Fair enough. The decision of what is the proper usage, i think, is best left to the platform. The default behavior can be what you propose. I was thinking of using the watchdog to detect EL3 hangs such that TWDG WS1 would be directed to something like an SCP(system control processor) to detect if the application processors has hung but you could argue for it\u0027s use to detect S-EL1/2 hangs. In this case, would we not want a handler for TWDG WS1 as opposed to a TWDG WS0 in EL3?",
