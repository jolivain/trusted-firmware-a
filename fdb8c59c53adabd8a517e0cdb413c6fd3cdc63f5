      "message": "How this 64-bit write actually happens is up to the compiler. On ARMv7/AArch32 there are multiple ways of doing larger-than-32-bit writes (strd, NEON, or ldmia/stmia, for instance). And later ARMv7 CPUs or even ARMv8 cores in AArch32 state surely have a memory bus wider than 32 bits. So on my test (with -O2) it chose strd. If the compiler decides to split it up, it probably would do for a reason (because it might be beneficial to do so on the selected -mcpu, for instance). That\u0027s the advantage of writing this in C, the author does not need to care about those hardware details.",
