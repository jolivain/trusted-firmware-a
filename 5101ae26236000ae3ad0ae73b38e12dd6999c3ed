      "message": "I understand the concern. While the function may appear generic, its actual usage context matters. It is in fact being called from what we consider “platform code” (see bl1_plat_handle_post_image_load). It\u0027s used to modify platform-specific data directly. In such cases, having this logic within the platform code is more appropriate than relying on generic code. The goal is to keep responsibilities clear and maintain a clean separation of concerns.",

      "message": "You\u0027re correct in noting that this function is utilized to modify platform-specific data. If it\u0027s intended to be implemented as a platform function, there should be accompanying actions from the platform. Alternatively, if it\u0027s a generic function then we need to understand its implications for the platform. I believe this API falls under the latter scenario.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s good to update the porting guide to outline the required platform actions for this API or its implications for the platform if it\u0027s generic.\n\nConsidering this, I suggest relocating the definition of this function to ``plat/common/plat_bl1_common.c`` and updating the porting-guide documentation accordingly.",
