      "message": "I understand the concern. While the function may appear generic, its actual usage context matters. It is in fact being called from what we consider “platform code” (see bl1_plat_handle_post_image_load). It\u0027s used to modify platform-specific data directly. In such cases, having this logic within the platform code is more appropriate than relying on generic code. The goal is to keep responsibilities clear and maintain a clean separation of concerns.",
