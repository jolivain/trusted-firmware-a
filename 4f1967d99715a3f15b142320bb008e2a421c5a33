      "message": "I thought so as well initially but when testing I found that this might not work if the previous errata isn\u0027t enabled since the call to get_rev_var is conditionally compiled. Can we guarantee that the two errata will always be enabled together?",

What if, there is a new errata ID that comes before(in terms of the number) and someone unaware of this optimization might insert the new errata mitigation between the two.",
