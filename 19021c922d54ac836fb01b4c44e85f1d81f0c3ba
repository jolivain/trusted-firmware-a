      "message": "I wonder if this patch is really needed. Since https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/26771, the `console_switch_state(CONSOLE_FLAG_RUNTIME);` is directly done in `bl31_main()` function. And in `bl31_plat_runtime_setup`, which is called at the end of BL31, you may not need CONSOLE_FLAG_BOOT flag. But I may be wrong. If really needed, could you explain why in the commit message?\n\nMinor thing: ATF acronym is no more used, please use TF-A instead.\nAnother strange thing is that we receive gerrit mails for your patches with: \u0027Name of user not set\u0027, whereas we can see BenjaminLimJL in gerrit web pages. Could you check again the \u0027Full Name\u0027 field in your gerrit settings?",
