      "message": "I believe its required here more from the readability part.\nI still agree with your comment and it might work too.\n\nBut there is a small diff here. Its not a feature specific flag like we have for other cases. There those flags would contain three states (0,1, 2).\n\nCTX_INCLUDE_AARCH32_REGS is a boolean flag, so (0,1).\n\ncontext_el1.h with #if and #else was mostly intended to cover the feature flags with three states (0,1,2) as we wanted to eliminate the #if usage in .c file.\n\nCTX_INCLUDE_AARCH32_REGS exactly doesn\u0027t fall into that category, but it was more close to be grouped there.\n\nSo similar to other use cases wherein we have a helper func for each feature inside if(), I thought to have it for this too.\n\nIf you think its not required, I am happy to remove it.\nLet me know your thoughts. Thanks!",
