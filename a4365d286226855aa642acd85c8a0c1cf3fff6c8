      "message": "I think it would be nice if the path structure under include/export/ mirrors the path structure of the rest of the repo. Since every export header should always have a corresponding wrapper header, this would make it more obvious which belongs to which. If we just throw it all at the top level, more headers with similar names get added in the rest of the repo later and then a use case comes up where those also need to be exported, I think it could become messy if there is no clear structure. I also think the export header should always have the same name (plus maybe a suffix if you think that\u0027s necessary) as its wrapper header, anything else is just unnecessarily confusing.",
