While it is not an intrinsic part of the FIP format, a BL33 image is required for these examples. For the purposes of experimentation, `Trusted Firmware-A Tests`_ (``tftf.bin``) may be used. Refer to to the `TFTF documentation`_ for instructions on building a TFTF binary.\n\nThe reason being that FIPs are mostly generic containers - BL33 is completely optional, so we don\u0027t want to give the user the impression that a BL33 image is some intrinsic part of building a FIP.",
