This patch mainly moved the measured boot init and finish function to the platform layer i.e. from measured_boot.h -\u003e platform.h, and hence we removed the measured_boot.h file and its inclusion from C file.\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/11577/5/include/drivers/measured_boot/event_log.h#95",
