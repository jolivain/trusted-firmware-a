      "message": "Hi Madhukar,\n\nInitially thought the same but we generally remove such information during every release.\nfor e.g. https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/2276. \nAs part of previous patches, we deprecated \"AARCH32/AARCH64\" using \u0027__aarch64__\u0027 (as there were some instances) so now, we don\u0027t have any instances of these macro in the code and hence I thought it is good to remove this information. We dont generally keep history here.\nLet me know your opinion. If such deletion is not needed then I am happy to abandon this patch.",
