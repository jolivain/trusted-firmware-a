FIPTool
=======

This project is normally built as part of the TF-A build flow, but standalone
builds (where the FIPTool directory is used as the CMake source directory) are
also supported.

For details on the |FIP| format please refer to :ref:`Firmware Design`.

The section :ref:`Building Supporting Tools` contains usage information
about ``fiptool``. Please ignore the legacy build information.

Building ``fiptool``
--------------------

The usual CMake build process is used, and requires no additional configuration.
Only the ``Unix Makefiles`` generator is officially supported, but other
generators should work without issue. Note that FIPTool is intended to compiled
using the host system toolchain.

For build commands and other CMake specific details please refer to section
:ref:`building_with_cmake_label`.

Dependencies

FIPTool relies on OpenSSL's crypto component library. Ubuntu users can install
this with::
