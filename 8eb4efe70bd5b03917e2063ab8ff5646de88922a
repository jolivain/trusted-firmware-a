According to the information in this document [1], Konstantin is the designated Code Owner for the Marvell platform, so it\u0027s preferable to seek Code Owner Review approval from him.\n\n@Konstantin can you please here? Thanks!\n\n[1]: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/maintainers.html",
