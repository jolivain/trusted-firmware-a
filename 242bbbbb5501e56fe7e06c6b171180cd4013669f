      "message": "With the introduction of this patch, as the same code can be used for GIC-500 and GIC-600, there is no need for GIC-500 driver file (drivers/arm/gic/v3/gic500.c). Can you make the appropriate changes in makefile drivers/arm/gic/v3/gicv3.mk such as making GIC-500 as default etc.\n\nHowever, I have a fundamental question about this. If I am not mistaken, the choice of which GIC implementation to use is taken at design time. The system integrator picks either GIC-500 or GIC-600 for integrating the SoC. Hence, using compile time options to pick either one in TF-A seems beneficial to me because using GIC-600 driver for GIC-500 seems like additional overhead.",
