      "message": "With the introduction of this patch, as the same code can be used for GIC-500 and GIC-600, there is no need for GIC-500 driver file (drivers/arm/gic/v3/gic500.c). Can you make the appropriate changes in makefile drivers/arm/gic/v3/gicv3.mk such as making GIC-500 as default etc.\n\nHowever, I have a fundamental question about this. If I am not mistaken, the choice of which GIC implementation to use is taken at design time. The system integrator picks either GIC-500 or GIC-600 for integrating the SoC. Hence, using compile time options to pick either one in TF-A seems beneficial to me because using GIC-600 driver for GIC-500 seems like additional overhead.",

      "message": "\u003e \"using compile time options ... seems beneficial\"\n\nAnd for exactly that reason I kept the old GIC-500 \"driver\" around.\nThe idea was the following:\n- If you know you have a GIC-500, you select GIC-500 at build time and get the same (minimal) support as before.\n- If you know you have a GIC-600, you select GIC-600 at build time, and now get that tiny extra check, but it doesn\u0027t really hurt.\n- If you don\u0027t know your GIC type (fastmodel or FPGA), you select GIC-600, and get support for both.\n\nYes, I thought about ditching the GIC-500 driver altogether, since it\u0027s indeed redundant, but then some people really want the exact minimal hardware support for their platform.\nHappy to remove the driver, though, if others agree. But that can also be done later.",
