I\u0027m still looking into it.\nIMO measurement of \u0027hash data\u0027 inside the certificate may not be critical because\n1. If the attacker corrupts the hash data inside the certificate that leads to the platform boot failure\n2. If the attacker modifies \u0027hash data\u0027 with its corresponding \u0027raw-images\u0027 for a successful boot that leads to different image measurements accumulated value (PCR0). This value does not match with an expected PCR0\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/11580/comment/b494fb39_ec5b5e53/\n\nWith this in mind, would it be OK to proceed with this patch and address the certificate measurement issue later on?",
