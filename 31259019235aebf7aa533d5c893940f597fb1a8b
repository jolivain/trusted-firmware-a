Although it failed, I looked into the failures and they all apply to another unrelated patch.\n\nRe-trigerring the CI loop on patch set #9, just in case... If it does not flag anything new, I\u0027ll override the Verified score manually.\n\n@Manish: Could you please provide MR+1 if you\u0027re happy with the way Raef addressed your comments in patch set #9? Then we can merge this patch.",
