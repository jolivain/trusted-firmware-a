Long story but as part of starting to build code coverage into the CI we are relying on tooling hosted on a site that is temporary unavailable. The change Leonardo has done has removed that dependency from the production VI so we should not be getting that now I hope.",

Check that ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE is set correctly, and the license server is available.\n\nLooks like an infrastructure error rather than an issue with your patch.
