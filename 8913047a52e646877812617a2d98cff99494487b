Long story but as part of starting to build code coverage into the CI we are relying on tooling hosted on a site that is temporary unavailable. The change Leonardo has done has removed that dependency from the production VI so we should not be getting that now I hope.",

If you do rerun tests you may then ask yourself, hang on where do I go for the results of the tests I kicked off as the CI UI does not tell me!!\n\nThe best approach is to visualise the CI pipeline to help you navigate to find them https://tf-ci-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tf-a-ci-pipeline-description\n\nWhen you trigger a job it starts a tf-ci-gateway job so navigate to that page. https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-ci-gateway/ Down the left hand side you will see the various gateway jobs.You have to click on them until you find your job. Mine as I said was https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-ci-gateway/12066/ and if you look at it it says it was started my me so thats normally a clue!\n\nIf you forget all these URL\u0027s remember https://ci.trustedfirmware.org as from that page you can find them all.\n\nOne last thing, make sure you are logged in to the CI site as you can look at results not logged in but to kick jobs off etc you need to be logged in. You should I hope be fully authorised but if not let me know.",

      "message": "Right, the https://qa-reports.linaro.org/tf/tf-gerrit-tforg-l1/build/1037/ site. I should have mentioned this in the Tutorial :-) \n\nSo remember the pipeline https://tf-ci-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tf-a-ci-pipeline-description well qa-reports (aka Squad) is a UI system onto the LAVA farm where docker images (containing FVP\u0027s etc) and physical boards reside that the scheduling Jenkins system (https://ci.trustedfirmware.org) request time on to run the tests. \n\nIts best to ignore the qa-reports site as it can confuse matters and just stick with the Jenkins reports. I\u0027ve asked it to be removed from the gerrit reporting system. It can still be accessed via the https://ci.trustedfirmware.org Jenkins site and test artefacts (eg test reports, UART logs, binaries generated etc) are copied into the appropriate Jenkins pages so these can be viewed in the context of the CI results pages but where you see a URL to a \"Test Job Id:xxxxxxx\" referenced it will take you to the LAVA UI.\n\nThe reason it said 3 failures may be because it has a retry system not visible to the Jenkins reporting. That is where for some reason something failed in the infrastructure it re-tries and if it works Jenkins never knows but in the qa-reports site its logged as a failure possibly along side real failures that will be propagated up to Jenkins.\n\nIt can be an alternative view and useful if some test artefact is missing but its easy to get lost in and I\u0027m not sure I fully understand  how it all hangs together sometimes!\n\nHence the request to remove it and if you really need it and are a CI \"Expert\" it  may be useful to you.",
