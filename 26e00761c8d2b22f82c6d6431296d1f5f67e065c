      "message": "\u003e This statement is confusing. Can you please elaborate with an example?\n\nI am afraid I cannot elaborate with a precise example right now because we are yet to prototype this approach to see how it works in practice. I only have a high-level, theoretical view right now, which is to use something like the PSCI cpu_ops structure, or the crypto_lib_desc_t structure defined using the REGISTER_CRYPTO_LIB() macro, or the driver interface exposed by most Linux drivers (all 3 examples are of the same type). \n\nI am reluctant to provide more guidance in this document until we have started the weak function removal effort. There might be other, acceptable ways we\u0027ve not thought about, which are not mentioned in this document, and this is just providing 2 design examples.\n\n\u003e There is another option, where platforms would like to include .weak functions from their own common code.\n\u003e e.g. plat/xxx/common, plat/xxx/board1, plat/xxx/board2\n\nIn my view, such platforms\u0027 own common code is still platform code and thus is in scope of the non-applicability/relaxation note at the start of this section. I don\u0027t think it needs calling out in a specific way.",

I think it\u0027s a worthy addition to the TF-A documentation, even without the details you were suggesting to add. We can always iterate with future patches.",
