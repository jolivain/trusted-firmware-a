Basically, this is automtaically enforced by the run time model. it does not matter whether interrupt handling completed or not..\none of the gaps in the implementation (if i remember right) is that we dont enforce that the SP deactivates and drops priority of the interrupt when it calls ffa_run or ffa_msg_wait. I would have liked it to return denied, or force priority drop/deactivation if these two events occured.\nLet me know if either of above is implemented..",
