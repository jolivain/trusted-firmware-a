      "message": "It seems the platform_api is not implemented properly by the platform. The contract for this API is to return a -ve value if mpidr is not valid and it should never return a value higher than PLATFORM_CORE_COUNT. \n\n\nNot sure whether generic code should try to validate against sloppy platform code as this is difficult to achieve for every case and we are on a slippery slope for validating platform API for every case. If at all, asserts should be enough to help catch these issues , but eventually platform code must follow contract and be hardened.",
