      "message": "Hi Harrison,\nI\u0027ve seen that the file ./bl2/bl2_el3.ld.S wasn\u0027t modified, was it just forgotten, or are there any other reasons?\nBy the way, this patch will impact all platforms. IIUC it only adds new linker macros, so I expect no real issue. But that could be good explaining a bit more about the goal of the patch in the commit message.\nAnother thing, memmap doesn\u0027t appear to be a correct scope in changelog.yaml. Or did I miss some other patch about that?\n\nBest regards,\nYann",
