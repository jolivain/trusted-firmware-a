It is better to not provide variability in TF-A where is not needed, just to avoid all the extra config options and code need to provide this variation.\n\nAlso PMUv3 is mandated by SBSA, so it is unlikely anyone builds a platform without this.\n\nRMM has also taken the path to assume PMUv3 and this can be asserted during boot.\n",
