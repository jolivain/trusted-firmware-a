      "message": "I think TF-A has been assuming PMUv3 since the beginning and it seems all platforms implement this. It is better to not provide variability in TF-A where is not needed, just to avoid all the extra config options and code need to provide this variation.\n\nAlso PMUv3 is mandated by SBSA, so it is unlikely anyone builds a platform without this.\n\nRMM has also taken the path to assume PMUv3 and this can be asserted during boot.\n",

      "message": "Well, I\u0027m indifferent towards the flag and won\u0027t particularly mind omitting it. It would be good to have it IMO as it is a valid fvp cmdline parameter and might be useful for debugging.\n\nFlag or not, I still want this patch and I it\u0027s important to me for the refactoring above. Is this all that\u0027s problematic?",
