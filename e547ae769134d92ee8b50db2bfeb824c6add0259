      "message": "I think using the TOS_FW_UUID, or a UUID in general here is not a good idea.\n1. The DT allows discovering the type of information inside using the compatibility strings. No need to replicate this capability at a higher level. The SP only needs to know the format. Thus here basically a UUID is mapped to DT format or parameter type. Reusing TOS_FW_UUID for this seem to be incorrect for me.\n2. Future execution of any S-EL0 SP under the S-EL3 SPMC pushes other SPMC implementations to reuse the methodology implemented here. Passing the TOS_FW_UUID to an S-EL0 SP running under OP-TEE SPMC looks strange. \n3. Moreover, in general using an UUID can be misleading. The main purpose of UUID is allowing multiple stakeholders defining non colliding ID values. But why would anybody use a different ID value to identify the DT format? Using a string like \"TYPE_DT\" would seem to be a better option to me.\n\nI suggest using a string like: \"TYPE_DTv1\". This would be more aligned with the purpose of this ID, and would remove any confusion on when and why a value change is expected.",

      "message": "IIUC now that the SPMC has been updated to use the v1.1 data structures the importance of the manifest name has now been reduced as most partitions will rely on the `type` field of the boot information descriptor to locate the required information. We still can provide a name as part of the descriptor so have left the existing UUID, if there is a preference for an alternative please let me know.",

      "message": "I think the \"value\" for the name filed shall be dynamically set from the manifest. Otherwise either the SPs need to implement SPMC specific behavior, or all SPMCs need to adapt this sometimes \"un-natural\" value. (Or the SPs have to ignore the name value, which would be a limitation.) I.e. when OP-TEE implements v1.1, using TOS_FW_UUID part of the boot info of an S-EL0 SP would look strange. In that scenario TOS_FW_CONFIG is the config of the TOS implementing the SPMC and boot info is the config of the SP.\n\nWe have an agreement between the SPMC and the SP about the details of the boot information. This agreement shall be as SPMC and SP independent as possible to avoid introducing tensions between SP and SPMC implementations. Configuring identification values trough the manifest is a way to add the needed flexibility.\n\nFIY: meanwhile FF-A 1.0 boot protocol support has been up-streamed to OP-TEE SPMC.
