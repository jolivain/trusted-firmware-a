      "message": "If I am not mistaken, GNU make is free to execute dependencies in any order it wants, the order in which you list them here in the makefile does not make any difference. Therefore, it could choose to first build the ${OBJECTS} then clean them, which is obviously not what we want. I expect that this issue should be quite easy to demonstrate if you try a parallel build (make -j).\n\nI believe you\u0027ll have to restructure these rules and their dependencies to fix this. \u0027clean\u0027 would need to be a dependency of ${OBJECTS} and Makefile if you want it to run first.",
