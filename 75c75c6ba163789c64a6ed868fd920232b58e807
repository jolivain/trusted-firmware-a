I believe we are always expecting this key to be ECDSA with the P-384 curve. Is that a requirement from the specification?",

It seems to act as a notifier for Nwd that the given request is completed. \nI\u0027m wondering why the push request can\u0027t block the call until the operation is completed by HES. Is it because the operation takes longer, necessitating the use of PULL_ATTEST_RESP SMC?",
