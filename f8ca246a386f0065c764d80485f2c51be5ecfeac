      "message": "I probably miss something, but what is the exact purpose of this patch? When I build just naively with (exemplarily) PLAT\u003darm_fpga, every feature that\u0027s listed should be set to \"2\" already. Setting ARM_ARCH_MINOR doesn\u0027t change anything. The only thing that drops support for those features is to explicitly specify ENABLE_FEAT_xxx\u003d0 on the build command line - and I think this is a valid use case, and be it for testing. If people want to shoot themselves in the foot, we should let them.",

      "message": "Agree, As discussed, This change would break of current option of enabling/disabling feature from cmdline, one foreseeable approach is to relax enforcing mandatory options in arch_features.mk and relax it to update only if not provided/defined yet using \u0027?\u003d\u0027 option.",
