      "message": "I think this actual definition made for Marvell DB board. This is what we use as PLAT for builds. The A8K and CN913x, for instance, have separate folders for different boards (platforms). So far A3700 DB definitions worked well for EspressoBin board too, but if different board-specific stuff is needed, we have to add a new folder under the top a3700 directory for handling it. For instance, for example a3k_nic_cz, a3k_espresso, etc.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how A3700 DB board is using wake up sources. But neither Espressobin nor Turris MOX do not use any wake up source. So setting \"empty list\" as a wake up sources looks like a good idea -- which I did in this change.\n\nAnyway, should not be configuration of wake up sources for A3700 DB board part of U-Boot A3700 DB board code?\n\nI do do not know if it makes sense to \"complicate\" TF-A build infrastructure and a3k source hierarchy just for setting \"empty list of wake up sources\". TF-A code for all A3720 boards is currently same. And I think it is better to have \"unified\" source code in this form.",

      "message": "As far as I remember, DB has a push button connected to GPIO that defined in this structure. So by removing these definitions you disable a feature that was working (and probably tested by QA). I believe also UART wake up source should work with all other A3700 platforms.",
