      "message": "Hi Manish,\n\nI checked the CI failure, rebased the changes and fixed the include orders. I have also submitted an extra change to tf-a-ci-scripts to add two build configurations to tf-cov-make. There are warnings about the copyright years but I would keep them as-is since I have not done anything substantial to the code this year.\n\nAlso, the build and boot test failure seems unrelated to my changes. Could you start another CI run?\n\nThanks,\nStephan",

Do we also need a review from lachitp/Saurabh, or is Nikita\u0027s Code-Owner-Review enough? While I would appreciate a review from someone at QTI, I am not sure if they are interested in an 8 year old platform. I did not touch any existing code in plat/qti, so there should not be any changes for their platform.\n\nAlso, is there something I should fix for the Legacy-CI/Verified-1, or is the failure unrelated to my changes? The logs from the Legacy-CI do not seem to be publicly available.",
