      "message": "Could you elaborate a bit on this? If I were to implement this for my platform based on this explanation, I am not sure I would understand what\u0027s being asked of me. Perhaps something along these lines (if it makes sense! Again my I/O layer knowledge is limited):\n\n This function is responsible for setting up the platform I/O policy that will\n be used to load FWU metadata from platform non-volatile storage. Unlike most\n I/O policies, this one cannot always be defined statically. For example, the\n location of the FWU metadata might be provided in a Global Partition Table (GPT),\n which needs to be dynamically parsed. This function provides a mean to retrieve\n such dynamic information.\n\n Only after this function has been called can further I/O layer operations\n be performed on the FWU metadata, such as io_open() or io_read().",
