      "message": "I am heavily leaning towards not following the OP-TEE example ðŸ˜ž Apologies for this but this SP ID allocation is not inline with the convention in Hf and OP-TEE i.e. top bit set to 1. \n\nThe hardcoded value of 0x1 for the StMM SP in OP-TEE predates this and was a hack. We would be incurring technical debt in making this the norm.\n\nIt would be best for TF-A to adopt the Hf/OP-TEE convention. The ID should be discovered through FFA_PARTITION_INFO_GET and FFA_ID_GET.\n\nBTW, I writing code to address my comments that I will share shortly. Raising the comments for alignment/visibility.",
