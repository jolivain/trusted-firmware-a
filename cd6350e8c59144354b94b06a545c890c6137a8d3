      "message": "Will update to:\n\nUpon booting, the SPMC running on the primary core shall register the secondary core entry points to which a given secondary core being woken up shall jump to into the SPMC . The current implementation assumes the SPMC calls a registering service implemented in the SPMD for each core identified by its MPIDR. This can typically happen in a simple loop implemented in the early SPMC initialization routines by passing each core identifier associated with an entry point address and context information.\nThis service is implemented on top of a more generic SPMC\u003c\u003d\u003eSPMD interface using direct request/response message passing as defined by the FF-A specification.",
