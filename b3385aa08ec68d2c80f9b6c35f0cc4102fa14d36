      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the right place for this print. It should be on a cold boot path so it\u0027s printed only once by TF-A for informational purpose.\nThe reality is that this code is on the PSCI paths, which means it is exercised on e.g. every PSCI suspend call from NWd. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s really relevant even in debug mode to know that \"AMU is not supported\" on any such event (which actually led to these spurious print outs leading to test timeouts).",
