      "message": "I believe this file isn\u0027t the appropriate place to house these Measure-Boot-related definitions. These definitions are commonly used across platforms unconditionally. These newly added definitions are only necessary during \u0027MEASURED_BOOT\u0027 support.\n\nI understand the intention behind relocating it from the specific Event Log header. However, in my opinion, we should move these to a header consumed specifically by the Measured-Boot implementation. Please let me know what do you think?",

      "message": "I fully agree with Manish.\n\nOn top of the reasons Manish already stated, all headers under `include/export/` are export headers that are intended for inclusion in third-party code which needs to interact with TF-A data structures or interfaces (see `include/export/README`), which is not the case for measured boot definitions AFAIK - so definitely not the right location for these macro definitions...\n\n\u003e we should move these to a header consumed specifically by the Measured-Boot implementation.\n\nHow about `include/drivers/measured_boot/metadata.h` for example? or `include/drivers/measured_boot/measurements_strings.h`?",
