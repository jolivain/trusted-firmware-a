These newly added definitions are only necessary during \u0027MEASURED_BOOT\u0027 support.\n\nI understand the intention behind relocating it from the specific Event Log header. However, in my opinion, we should move these to a header consumed specifically by the Measured-Boot implementation. Please let me know what do you think?",
