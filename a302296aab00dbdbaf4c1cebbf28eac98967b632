      "message": "Main changes between v1 and v2:\n\n* Added documentation for ENABLE_CONSOLE_GETC build option.\n* Also added a recommendation to disable getc in the Secure Development Guidelines.\n* Removed getc callback from struct console.\n* Took care of Uniphier and DCC console drivers.\n* Fixed the disabling logic in AArch64 version of finish_console_register().\n* Took care of AArch32 version of finish_console_register().\n  Aligned the code with the AArch64 version for simplicity.\n* Removed assembly error message \"getc() support is disabled. Do not register a getc() console callback.\n  The compiler will already emit error messages about missing definition of CONSOLE_GETC_T macro, which I feel are sufficient.",
