      "message": "as I mentioned previously in my review -\u003e we wont be able to drop this check, ever. This is because over the last 8-10 years we have a ton of firmwares on older products without this support, and that is not something we can randomly regress. \n\nSo, in fact document the fact in the code so that no one is tempted to remove the code in the future (and ofcourse, drop the above comment -\u003e which btw, is wrong c coding style..)\n\n```\n/*\n * multi-line comment\n * multi-line comment\n */\n```",

      "message": "The question is why are people using bleeding edge TF-A with 8-10 years older firmware, I don\u0027t think even we test that functionality and if we don\u0027t test it then it\u0027s not like we have been supporting it. \n\nIf someone doesn\u0027t want to upgrade, there is still limited support as till which TF-A version they can upgrade it to and if they want continued support then they can definitely upgrade the firmwares if they want to. \n\nSaying we can never drop it is a very strong statement IMHO that I am not sure if we have committed to. If we are committing to that then we need to start testing it as well like that.",
