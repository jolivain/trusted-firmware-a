      "message": "This platform interface does not sound right to me... Despite its generic name, it\u0027s actually very specific, in that it assumes that it\u0027s being called for a configuration file that needs loading in both root and secure memory. I think that\u0027s more or less the same concern as what Olivier raised internally.\n\nPerhaps we could instead make it return the primary and secondary load addresses of the image, aligned with my other comments in this patch review.\n\nBut TBH I think the code would be clearer if each DTB property was queried separatey, instead of a bulk query of both addresses and size. I\u0027ve put another comment to show what I have in mind in the next patch:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/18802/comment/a8111835_3366188e/",

The single platform function can return all details (primary and secondary addresses, and size), as we are introducing \u0027primary\u0027 and \u0027secondary\u0027 load addresses that make this platform function generic and no longer dependent on RME. The primary load-address is valid, but the secondary address can be valid or NULL, depending on config file.\n\nThe secondary address should be valid in some cases, e.g. here [1], where the root(primary) address should not be passed to BL32. Please let me know what do you think?\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/18802/3/services/std_svc/spmd/spmd_main.c#438",
