      "message": "Some comments from the internal gerrit:\n\nThis change would most likely need a documentation update describing how the openssl build process is integrated.\nNot sure wat level of detail would be needed as the TF-A docs are a bit sparse on the same matter related to e.g. MbedTLS.\n\nI am not sure if it is a good idea to add this build support in general. Maintaining this might not be worth for a host side only component needed for a single tool.\n\nAnyway this patch + a repo manifest fetching openssl too is a perfect solution for my short term needs. (I just needed a place from where repo can fetch the needed TF-A change.) The other option to extend our build environment with openssl3 would not align that well with our dependency handling methodology, as the build environment would have to work different based on the TF-A version.",

      "message": "Hi,\n\ngood idea, but I do have some concerns. Usually makefiles do not implement system discovery and instead use static configuration. Discovery is usually implemented in a higher layer like autoconf (or cmake). Of course we can go our own ways, but aligning to well established patterns might make maintenance easier by avoiding surprises. Moreover static configuration adapts to the the \"KISS\" principle better. \n\nFor me Yanns suggestion to use static configuration but avoid mixing the \"location of openssl\" with the \"please build openssl\" setting seems to be a better choice.

      "message": "In short this is how make works (see docs here [1]):\n  - make will convert all environment variables to make variables.\n  - when using :\u003d or \u003d in a makefile, this will define a make variable and override environment variables\n  - ?\u003d can be used to avoid overriding values taken over from the environment\n  - command line params (e.g. variable\u003dvalue) will override the variable values set with the above methods.\n  - makefile can use the override directive to override any value set with the methods above. But IHMO this is not used in TF-A makefiles.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, the command line parameter has the highest precedence (as TF-A makefiles do not use the override directive, and assuming you are not running make with -e).\nThe biggest risk IMHO is name collision when using ?\u003d. If anything in the build environment uses an environment variable with the same name as a TF-A makefile variable set with ?\u003d, there is a collision. The same environment variable will be used for two different purposes, which will not work. To be on the safe side, the best might be to use a project specific prefix for such variables (e.g. CFGTFA_ for this project).\n\n1: https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.79.1/html_chapter/make_6.html#SEC63",
