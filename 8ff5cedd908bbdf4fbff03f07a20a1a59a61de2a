      "message": "Some comments from the internal gerrit:\n\nThis change would most likely need a documentation update describing how the openssl build process is integrated.\nNot sure wat level of detail would be needed as the TF-A docs are a bit sparse on the same matter related to e.g. MbedTLS.\n\nI am not sure if it is a good idea to add this build support in general. Maintaining this might not be worth for a host side only component needed for a single tool.\n\nAnyway this patch + a repo manifest fetching openssl too is a perfect solution for my short term needs. (I just needed a place from where repo can fetch the needed TF-A change.) The other option to extend our build environment with openssl3 would not align that well with our dependency handling methodology, as the build environment would have to work different based on the TF-A version.",
