      "message": "So this fails to compile in the CI for that one fvp-no-optimize-default build job, which apparently removes the -Os (?), defaulting to -O0 (at the moment!).\nIt only reports here, because for the other features we default to \"2\" now, so we get all feature support files compiled in. Which means that -O0 would fail on other features (like TRBE and BRBE below) as well, if those would be set to 0, on the build command line.\nDo we really care about -O0? I hear this 20th century rationale of \"help debugging\", but the code generated by -O0 is outright stupid and not used anywhere, so I am wondering if supporting this is paying a too high price?\nThe alternative would be to go back and provide empty stubs for every *_enable function, which we were trying to avoid.",
