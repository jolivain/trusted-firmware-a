      "message": "1) Putting the check in this file applies it to all NCAT generation SoCs, but as far as I can tell, the special register arrangement is unique to variants of H616.\n2) The BSP specifically checks for a die version of 2, not just any nonzero version:\nhttps://github.com/smaeul/sun20i_d1_spl/blob/d21a737da79521923e2f235891dab7b7fe5692ff/include/arch/cpu_ncat.h#L179\n3) The value computed here is the same as that returned by plat_get_soc_revision() (which avoids needing to move the SUNXI_SRAM_VER_REG definition).",

      "message": "1) Ouch, I totally missed that! And indeed I see no secondaries coming online on the H6 (for which most (all?) chips report die revision 1). I will move that into the per-SoC include stubs.\n2) Fair enough, I saw this, but didn\u0027t have any other information, and my H616s report both 0. Will follow the BSP to check for 2 explicitly.\n3) Ah, that\u0027s a good hint! So I can drop the SRAM_VER_REG refactor patch altogether, and just call this function from here.",
