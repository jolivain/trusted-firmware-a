Value for Uncategorized and implementation defined is not defined by ARM.\n\nAArch32 doesn\u0027t have CE, so my understanding is code is initially written for AArch32 ref: section: D19.4.1 PE error state recording in the exception syndrome in Arm Architecture Reference Manual for A-profile architecture\n\nAs far as naming is concerned, I followed the convention i.e. older (AArch32) + newer (AArch64 addition) to ensure I don\u0027t break any UET (AArch32) dependencies.",
