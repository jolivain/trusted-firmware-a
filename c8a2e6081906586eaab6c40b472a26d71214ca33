Also the size issue might be fixed later.\nSo I think what we want is the *default* to be set depending on the build settings:\nSUNXI_AMEND_DTB should be enabled by default if SCPI is enabled or we run from DRAM.\nSUNXI_AMEND_DTB should be off by default if this is an A64 DEBUG\u003d1 build.\n\nSo people should be able to always override it on the command line, but a normal \"make PLAT\u003dsun50i_x DEBUG\u003dy\" build would always succeed.\n\nWhat I\u0027d suggest:\nLet it default to 1 in allwinner-common.mk for SCPI or DRAM builds.\nLet it default to 0 in sun50i-a64/platform.mk for DEBUG\u003d1 builds (before the include!).\nWould that work?",

      "message": "\u003e Would that work?\n\nNo. I am not okay with DEBUG\u003d0/1 intentionally changing the behavior of the firmware in ways unrelated to debugging. That creates situations where enabling debugging magically makes problems go away, or introduces new problems, thus preventing debugging the original issue. We can set the defaults for SUNXI_* options however we want, but DEBUG\u003d must not affect them.\n\nIf you want to omit the forced error message, I am okay with that, though I expect it will lead to increased complaints about build failures, since I doubt most people following some HOWTO can/will want to investigate any build failures. (And if we make this change, `make PLAT\u003dsun50i_a64 DEBUG\u003d1 bl31` will fail. I don\u0027t really know why various documentation suggests a DEBUG\u003d1 build anyway, but that\u0027s the situation we\u0027re in.)",

      "message": "So I see your point that DEBUG\u003d1 should not affect the feature set built in.\nThe suggestion of using DEBUG\u003d1 by default was to help \"remote debugging\", so that people can report meaningful information with an out-of-the-box build, not requiring them to rebuild TF-A.\nSo I think we need to solve this properly: SUNXI_AMEND_DTB should be enabled by default, but I don\u0027t want to lose the ability to do DEBUG\u003d1 builds.\nMaybe we can scale back on some debug messages, to decrease code and data size? And my gut feeling is that we still waste code and data somewhere, especially due to the vector table alignment. So I will try (again) to find some tricks to avoid excessive padding, and make more use of the available space.\n\nIf anyone (Samuel?) has any good pointers or some insight or ideas, I am all ears.\n\nIn the long run there is hope with us losing the regulator setup code, this can be done by U-Boot, with now mostly default build options missing. So maybe in a year or so we could switch the default to SUNXI_SETUP_REGULATORS\u003d0, saving us some space.",

Because of page alignment of .rodata, .data, these section have enough space and optimizations here (string merges and so on) will not help much. The problem is increased .text section.\n\nIMHO, getting rid of vector table alignment will not help without some extra code reduction. vector table has size of 0x800 bytes and free space after the code and before vector table is 0x698/0x6f8 bytes. Without removing some extra code number of used pages will be the same.",
