I\u0027m not sure I understand the decision of OP-TEE to only accept device tree bindings that are defined in kernel documentation and I don\u0027t really agree with it -- if the device tree is the only official way to pass information into OP-TEE, then there will necessarily be use cases for some things in it that are not pure hardware-description but are actually user data specific to OP-TEE, like this is. And in those cases, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s reasonable to expect those bindings to be documented in some completely different, unrelated project. It would maybe make sense to add device tree binding documentation directly in OP-TEE for this purpose instead.\n\nBut if OP-TEE maintainers disagree with that and say that kernel bindings are the only way, then we should at least try to honor that and actually get it documented in the kernel. We can still go back to bad workarounds if that fails.",
