That\u0027s why we can\u0027t really make these bindings \"official\" and submit them to the kernel\u0027s Documentation/bindings, because they\u0027re not really bindings for the kernel so it would seem kinda silly to try to document them there (and presumably would not be accepted by the kernel maintainers).",
