Best I can tell, pm_ret_status is defined in .../plat/xilinx_versal/pm_service/pm_defs.h, and its enum labels have integer values in the range 1 to 2007 (all well under 0xffff).  One enum label, PM_RET_SUCCESS, does not appear to have an integer value, so perhaps its integer value \"could be anything.\"  However, supposing its given a value \u003e0xffff, ANDing it with 0xffff would seem only to make it something outside the defined values of that enum?",
