      "message": "Sorry if I\u0027m being dense, but I\u0027m not sure I follow the point in this masking operation.  Best I can tell, pm_ret_status is defined in .../plat/xilinx_versal/pm_service/pm_defs.h, and its enum labels have integer values in the range 1 to 2007 (all well under 0xffff).  One enum label, PM_RET_SUCCESS, does not appear to have an integer value, so perhaps its integer value \"could be anything.\"  However, supposing its given a value \u003e0xffff, ANDing it with 0xffff would seem only to make it something outside the defined values of that enum?",

      "message": "Hi Gary Morrison,\nPM_RET_SUCCESS is at the start of enum, so it\u0027s value is 0 only. Yes I agree that we haven\u0027t assigned 0 explicitly same as other values in enum. We will do that in separate patch.\nHere it is fixed that pm_ret_status will be \u003c 0xffff only.",

      "message": "So again, apologies if I\u0027m missing something obvious here, but if this is an enum where all possible values are well under 0xffff, then what\u0027s the value in ANDing it with 0xffff?  Even if some values were \u003e0xffff, then ANDing with 0xffff presumably wouldn\u0027t likely produce a valid enum value, I\u0027d think?\n\nIs some other value being passed back in the upper halfword or something like that?",
