As the register names are slightly different (the appendix \"IMP_\" you mentioned for N2) I was considering to have different definitions on the headers for each Neoverse N variant.\n\nI finally decided to move it here, though, as this register is also considered \"Implementation defined\" for Neoverse N1 and so far they are equivalent (or almost) for all the Neoverse N series.",
