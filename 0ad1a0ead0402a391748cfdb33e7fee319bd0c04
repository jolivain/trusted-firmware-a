Same for previous patch. The dedicated code for our platform is in the next patches in the series.\n\nHi Yann,\nAgree that the USB DFU stack is not tied to the platform, but exposing this stack motivates others to use it for a firmware update. Is it secure to use the USB DFU stack for a firmware update? \nI think the PSA FWU specification provides proper secure flow to update the firmware that can be used instead. Please let me know what do you think?\n\n\u003e But it could be changed if needed.\n\u003e \n\u003e Regards,\n\u003e Yann",
