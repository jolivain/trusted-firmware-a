Please let us know what do you think? Thanks!\n\n[1]: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0118/a/\n[2]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/q/topic:%22fw-update-2%22+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)",

I am assuming this is very much a platform-specific provision.\n\u003e By the way we are also working internally and with Linaro to support FWU on STM32MP1.\nGood to know.
