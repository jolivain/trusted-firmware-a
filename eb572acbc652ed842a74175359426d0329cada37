      "message": "I believe the platform makefile is only included on line 646, much later than this is processed. In the commit message it says \"...given march value from MAJOR/MINOR values from platform...\" which I don\u0027t think is true in that case. Since the goal is for this to have platform inputs, is there anything stopping it from being done after the platform makefile?",
