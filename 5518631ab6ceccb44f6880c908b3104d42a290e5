You need to allocate the datastore in the arm_spmc_shmem_datastore section.\nThe linker will ensure it is placed at the start of the ARM_EL3_TZC_DRAM1_BASE carveout because you are placing that section before tzc dram.\n\nRevert to the previous change and change the section to arm_spmc_shmem_datastore.",
