      "message": "With this patch, can we now select ECDSA with BrainPool curve through the KEY_ALG TF-A build option? If yes,\n* Could you please update docs/getting_started/build-options.rst to mention it in the list of possible values for this option?\n* I believe this isn\u0027t tested in the CI right now. IIUC, STM32MP1 platforms use ECDSA NIST curve right now [1] so no platform actually uses the BrainPool curve. Am I right? If yes then could you try adding some level of testing? At least a build regression test. Not sure we can do better at this stage, as I believe STM32MP1 boards are still not available in the OpenCI... And adding support for the BrainPool curve for FVP platforms (which are available in OpenCI) might be a little involved.\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17181/7/plat/st/stm32mp1/platform.mk#399",

      "message": "Thanks. I had no doubt you\u0027ve tested it on your side but if we had CI tests on top of that it would help catching potential regressions in the future. As I said, I would be happy with just a couple of build tests, is it possible to add them as part of your CI patch [1] please?\n\nTo be clear, I am talking about adding 2 build config files under tf-a-ci-scripts/tf_config/. One with KEY_ALG\u003decdsa-brainpool-regular and another one with KEY_ALG\u003decdsa-brainpool-twisted. I suppose these could target STM32MP platforms? It doesn\u0027t matter so much for build-only tests I suppose. And then we\u0027d add the corresponding tf-a-ci-scripts/group/tf-l1-build-plat/*ecdsa-brainpool-regulat/twisted*:nil test configs.\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/17196",
