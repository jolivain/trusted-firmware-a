      "message": "I have matched the list to what\u0027s in the CI. It should pass (and almost has but it\u0027s still running). All removed cpus are not tested at all.\n\nAs for the testing, yes it is a little annoying, but I don\u0027t really have any other ideas for pain-free ways to reduce the binary size in the short term. Everything I\u0027ve come up with so far will include disabling tests or refactoring them. Disabling tests doesn\u0027t sound like a good idea and no-one want to spend lots of time on refactoring tf-a and/or tests as far as I can tell.",

      "message": "Had discussed earlier today with Boyan. I would treat this as only a short term work around for the binary size issue we face now. At a minimum it has to align with the current CI cpu list for now. Longer term if we reduce the CPU list, we should pick the CPUs based on good representation for various arch features/extensions, A32 vs A64, CPUs support both or one, Neoverse, X-series, Cortex series, big/little etc, most recent vs oldest, HW coherency vs S/W assisted coherency etc. Hope it makes sense.",
