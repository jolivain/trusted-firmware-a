      "message": "I guess the reason for setting in the GICv3 driver is because this register is GICv3 specific.\n\u003e This register is present only when FEAT_GICv3 is implemented and (EL2 is implemented or EL3 is implemented). Otherwise, direct accesses to ICC_SRE_EL2 are UNDEFINED.\n\nI believe we can be confident systems implementing FEAT_SEL2 and/or FEAT_RME also implement FEAT_GICv3.\n\nAlthough CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS doesn\u0027t enforce this especially when writing to the register there is a risk of generating an undef exception:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/21076/66/lib/el3_runtime/aarch64/context_mgmt.c#1119",
