      "message": "This doesn\u0027t sound correct in the longer term. You must retrieve the boot_index and take all the images from that index to boot the platform. \nConsider if the last boot failed because of authentication/maximum watchdog reset, then in the subsequence reboot, the image must be taken from the previous active bank (i.e. calling plat_fwu_get_boot_idx). \n\nso IMO better change this to \n   boot_index \u003d plat_fwu_get_boot_idx()\n\nI don\u0027t think then needs to re-execute the whole logic of retrieving the boot_index during the post-load operation [1]. You can reuse this function \u0027plat_fwu_get_boot_idx\u0027 to return the calculated boot_index directly.\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/12577/5/plat/st/stm32mp1/bl2_plat_setup.c#471",
