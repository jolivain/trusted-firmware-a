      "message": "So I looked at this, and it looks like we can simplify the CI scripts by using this new feature.\nBut I guess this patch here should be merged first, because any CI change would depend on this? Once this has reached the master branch, we can push any CI change?\nOr is there some special process in place for those cases?",
