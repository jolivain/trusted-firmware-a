      "message": "The PLAT_RSS_NOT_SUPPORTED option will eventually be removed as a cleanup activity, as it seems less useful. Only the FVP platform uses it currently. Initially, it was used to showcase the reference implementation, but now we have TC platform that supports RSS and exercises actual RSS communication APIs so these mock\u0027ed APIs at this layer are not needed (and can be handled at the platform layer).",
