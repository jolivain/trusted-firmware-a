      "message": "Hmm, this function is very complex when EL2 is present in all worlds (el2_unused is not relevant and probably broken for newer CPUs) even though this is compiled out as a result of conditional flags. And in BL31, this function is only used for exit NS when EL2 is present in all worlds.\n\nSo, a simplified cm_prepare_el3_exit_ns() is the function that should matter for BL31 for newer CPUs.  \n\nI can see that the current implementation is a bit convoluted. But a smaller function for BL31 catering for NS exit and avoiding legacy cases is desirable. Perhaps bl31_prepare_next_image_entry() should just call this function directly and remove capability to transition to S world (this was legacy) when CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS is set.",

      "message": "But this sort of thinking led to the current cm_prepare_el3_exit_ns(). This patch is the first attempt to simplify it - remove redundancy. I can then factor out unnecessary things and hopefully simplify it more. The legacy case can then be relegated to a an if statement with a function call. I don\u0027t see why duplicating code should be the solution to a slightly inconvenient legacy case. I think this code can be tamed.",

      "message": "Hmm, redundancy is good to avoid but here in this case, we are coupling the new method for feature enablement with a legacy case. The reason to detach the new case was to ensure that we dont have any latent issues from legacy way affecting the new one and have a clean implementation.\n\nEventually, the intention is to deprecate the old API and have only the `_ns` version for BL31. BL31 needs to call only the new API and the capability to specify S image after BL31 can be removed IMO. This can be tried and if CI passes, the old API can be made BL1 only.",
