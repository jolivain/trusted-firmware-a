      "message": "Hmm, this function is very complex when EL2 is present in all worlds (el2_unused is not relevant and probably broken for newer CPUs) even though this is compiled out as a result of conditional flags. And in BL31, this function is only used for exit NS when EL2 is present in all worlds.\n\nSo, a simplified cm_prepare_el3_exit_ns() is the function that should matter for BL31 for newer CPUs.  \n\nI can see that the current implementation is a bit convoluted. But a smaller function for BL31 catering for NS exit and avoiding legacy cases is desirable. Perhaps bl31_prepare_next_image_entry() should just call this function directly and remove capability to transition to S world (this was legacy) when CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS is set.",
