      "message": "I wonder, most of the RAS oriented testing in TF-A CI relies on SError injection and none (to my knowledge) on Group0 interrupts qualified as RAS interrupt.\n1. is this specific to NV platforms to handle RAS errors through G0 interrupts? Isn\u0027t the SError signal used in those scenarios?\n2. If SError is handling, does it require a similar change around HANDLE_EA_FIRST option to trap SError at EL3 while normal world runs, but not while SEL1/0 runs (that would rather be trapped by SPMC and panic)?\n3. In light of 1., would it require adding RAS related tests using G0 interrupts?\n\nApologies if my questions look naive, I\u0027m discovering RAS handling quite a bit.",

      "message": "For #1, complex SOCs have many errors that can only be reported by interrupts and may not translate to SErrors. I\u0027ve seen this in non NV SoCs as well and is not uncommon on server SoCs.\nFor #2, ideally yes, but in our design we have accepted that SErrors occurring during secure world execution is treated like a double fault and we are accepting of panic in SPMC. On Server SoCs, execution is expected to be almost always in normal world\nFor #3, same issue as espi. What G0 interrupt could i use on FVP? Happy to add a test where i have G0 interrupt routed to SEL1/EL0 in presence of SPMC. Thinking i could re-use the spm-mm interrupts.\n\nlet me know your thoughts.",

The fix would be to dispatch this condition from setup_context_common to setup_ns_context (trap to EL3) and setup_realm_context/setup_secure_context (no trap to EL3). Anyways this is beyond the current change.\nOn #3.: it\u0027s not an immediate query wrt current change, more a general brainstorm on the test coverage. On FVP the trusted watchdog is able to generate secure interrupts. Tf-a-tests SPMC/secure interrupts tests configure them as Group1S. I\u0027m thinking we could have a dedicated test configuring those secure interrupts to Group0 specifically cover those cases. I\u0027m not sure about what spm-mm uses but worth a look.\nPlease resolve if you agree with above.",

      "message": "Olivier, for #2, great point. i thought the architecture when SPMC was present SEAs and SEIs are trapped to SPMC correct? If yes, i think the fix you are tlaking about is required. We do plan to have RAS_EXTENSIONS enabled, which means HANDLE_EA_EL3_FIRST has to be set (per the docs), and would trap to EL3. We have logic to know this occured in secure world and die but to keep it clean, it would be best to do what you said. Would you be opposed to me providing a patch for this?\n\nAck on #3. Let me explore spmm and G0 interrupt separately. Definitely need to add test for this.\n\nResolving.",
