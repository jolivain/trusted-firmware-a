      "message": "Hello,\n\nWhen validating ATF v2.8 on Hikey960, in FF-A configuration (SPMC_AT_EL3\u003d1), we are hitting this assert().\nReverting the patch allows us to boot the board.\n\nInterestingly, the issue does not appear on non-FFA configuration (SPD\u003dtbase).\n\nThanks,\nLukas",

      "message": "Hello LukasHanel, which assert are you hitting? \n\nThe spec clearly says HCS DP will be set along with IS.UCCS and no polling is required:\n```\nIn case the GenericErrorCode of the completed DME_LINKSTARTUP command is SUCCESS, the HCS.DP is set in addition to the IS.UCCS bit.\n```\nSo after we see IS.UCCS bit and GenericErrorCode, we should instantly see HCS DP set (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.7/source/drivers/ufs/core/ufshcd.c#L4764)\n\nAs for the other assert, I see this in JEDEC spec:\n```\nUTP Transfer Request List Ready (UTRLRDY): This field indicates whether the host\ncontroller is ready to process UTP Transfer Request.\nThis field is cleared to ‘0’ by host controller when one of the following conditions occur:\n The device presence is not detected;\n UTP Transfer Request List is full;\n There is an error with host controller or device that is not command specific.\nHost software shall only set the UTRLRSR bit to ‘1’ if HCS. UTRLRDY is set to ‘1\u0027\n```\nIf you are hitting the UTRLRSR assert, then we should check if HCS.UTRLRDY is set before setting UTRLRSR, if it isn\u0027t then it\u0027s an IO error (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.7/source/drivers/ufs/core/ufshcd.c#L4556)",
