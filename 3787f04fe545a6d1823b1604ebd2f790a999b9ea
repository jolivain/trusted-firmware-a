      "message": "It may be better to enhance el3_panic to print the CPU context as well and remove the decision making in EL3 (whether to call elx_panic or el3_panic). \n\nIt is OK to print info in panic handler which is not relevant to a particular crash and we have one function to harder to test and validate for all panic() cases thus improving the maintainability of TF-A",

      "message": "We need to do something if this comparison is equal to EL3? The problem is that there are cases when RAS extension is not enabled, which can trigger this panic with SPSR_EL showing as `EL3`.\n\nMy suggestion is for the caller to call elx_panic() unconditionally.",
