      "message": "okay but why? EEL2 is currently *not* set for all contexts, so does this patch need to change this?\n\nEEL2 only matters for Secure world as far as I can tell. It enables SEL2 and allows access to ICC_SRE_EL2 when SCR_EL3.NS\u003d0. When SCR_EL3.NS\u003d1 it has absolutely no effect - so it doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s set for the NS/R EL2. And I put guards around the problematic parts (like ICC_SRE_EL2) to make sure it doesn\u0027t matter.",
