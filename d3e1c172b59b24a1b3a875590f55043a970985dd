      "message": "so that\u0027s an interesting one: it complains about the order of the include files, but there is only one! That\u0027s admittedly a corner case, since this file consists of just a single #include, so I wonder if that\u0027s some issue in the static analysis tool?",

And I didn\u0027t spot that either, because I was staring at an old branch, with didn\u0027t carry this extra include. So I fixed the inclusion order, should be all good now.",
