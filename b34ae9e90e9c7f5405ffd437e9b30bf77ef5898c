      "message": "Would it be possible to confirm or add further clarification in the comments? it seems like an soc pre 8.2, might have DSB implementations that does nothing related to syncing pending aborts(unless somebody can confirm most or all soc\u0027s sync aborts on DSB\u0027s). These SoC\u0027s will be paying a perf penalty on the DSB on almost every entry to EL3(think PSCI etc). Could we put it under a build option ?",

      "message": "I have updated the commit message and provided some comments in the handler code. Here is my understanding from the discussions I had with multiple folks inside Arm:\nDSB is a superset of ESB and is a heavyweight operation compared to ESB. \nDSB essentially synchronizes the program flow by draining any stores stuck in H/W buffers(not caches) till the point of serialization and getting appropriate responses back to CPU. If the memory access led to an error ( i.e., asynchronous external abort), it will lead to SError interrupt which will be handled appropriately. The barrier is needed at both the entry and exit of the handler code. This is necessary to isolate the SError to appropriate EL context. \nI believe this is required functionality , though at the cost of performance penalty.",
