      "message": "I would rather see another build option introduced instead of deleting code. There are use cases where the secure physical timer is used by EL3 and the NS timer registers that are context switched are used by secure partitions on platforms that don\u0027t use OPTEE for example(and instead use FF-A based SPMC/SPMD etc).\n\n\nAlso some things to keep in mind: Not all platforms run OPTEE, not all platforms run linux. Not all platforms allow secure physical timer access to S-EL1/S-EL0. The use of timers should be a platform decision.",

      "message": "I agree with you that there could be varying software stacks that could run in secure and non-secure worlds. But I am curious to know how a particular timer can be shared among secure and non-secure entity at runtime.\n\nAFAIK, a timer operates using a Private Peripheral Interrupt (PPI) and if we need to share a particular timer then this interrupt needs to be dynamically assigned during context switch as well and I can\u0027t find corresponding implementation in TF-A.\n\nAnd suppose if non-secure entity has setup a timer to fire every 10 ms and need to do context switch to secure entity. So would that timer fire reliably every 10 ms?\n\nIMO, EL3 should be able to reliably share secure physical timer with secure EL1 in case secure timer interrupt is routed via EL3.",
