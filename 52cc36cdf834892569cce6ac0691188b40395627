      "message": "We\u0027re now forking the gic init paths of virt and sbsa, which is good and correct. But I think we should then move this file out of the common directory into the plat/qemu/qemu directory.\n*additionally*, I\u0027d then like to move the gic-specific parts of this function into a new file in plat/qemu/qemu_sbsa.\n\nI think it would then make sense to drop all of the \"v3\" references where possible (on this side of the tree, let the virt maintainers make that call for themselves) - we want to keep supporting whatever the most recent version is, even if the architecture descends into CVS-style numbering (all hail GICv5.7.342.7).",
