The only validation you are doing is checking fo null and then doing register reads. Please ensure that it does not cause a fault if invalid values are passed.\n\nSecond point is, For above two i see you validate first argument, if the 1st argument is same for all function you can do validation in mtk_iommu_handler() itself.",
