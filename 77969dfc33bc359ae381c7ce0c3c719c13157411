      "message": "disable_mmu_el3() below already issues isb + dsbsy so I think it is OK to remove the barriers here. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s important that the MMU is disabled at EL1 *before* we disable it at EL3, right? I would think both operations can be committed in batch and their order does not matter.\n\nBut then, as I understand it, the performance of this code is not critical, given that it\u0027s debug code for pre-silicon. So you might want to keep them just to be on the safe side, in case disable_mmu_el3() ever gets changed and the barriers removed (which I doubt...). Your call.",
