If there is not, then relaxing this statement (e.g. issuing an informational message instead) would avoid discouraging those who just want to try out the DRTM Service.\n\nAdditionally, we think that variations to Trusted Boot are also acceptable (e.g. measurement only), so perhaps this is another argument pro pushing out the exact policy choice for securing DRTM.",

I agree it should be either authenticated or measured. IMO former will be the best choice as it is undesirable to have an un-authenticated service doing any measurement. \nI agree to change this dependency message from \u0027error\u0027 to \u0027info\u0027 for now, and to see what other platform owners thinks about it. \nAlso, I think we should put either MEASURED_BOOT(SRTM) or TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT as a dependency on DRTM, but leaving DRTM without any dependency should not be the choice. Let me know what do you think?",

      "message": "i dont think it is good to couple srtm and DRTM. DRTM was created to overcome some of the SRTM problems with maintaining large TCB and since srtm is not necessarily as trustworthy or is brittle. Making a solution to the SRTM problem, depend on SRTM does not seem right. For drtm, dependency on authenticated code is inevitable i think given that the D-CRTM is in mutable code(at least in this case since bl31 is D-crtm if i understand correctly). I think it makes sense to force the dependency on authentication (Trusted board boot). Depending on srtm is not necessarily all bad since we can consider code before BL31 as not part of \"gap code\" but i think it is best if SRTM and DRTM are independent.\n\nI;ve said in the past that measured boot(SRTM) and authenticated boot should be independent since the S-CRTM typically lives (or should live) in immutable code, so there is no need for that dependency between measured and trusted boot. Also, if there is a dependency between srtm and tbbr, breaking authenticated boot means breaking measured boot, which is best avoided. However that is not necessarily true for DRTM because of DCRTM living in mutable code. generally, avoiding dependencies between different security features, if it makes sense and is possible, should be the approach IMHO.",

      "message": "I would like to understand the reasoning for relying on TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT. This flag is spread across BL1, BL2 and relies on the implementation there. I am worried that it might negatively impact platforms that do not use these BLx components. I agree with Manish Pandey that this needs to be a platform choice.\n\nI would argue that the dependency should be removed from here and moved to Arm platforms instead. That way all platform assumptions will remain contained.",
