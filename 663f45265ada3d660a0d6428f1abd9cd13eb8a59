      "message": "Sure, but there is no root context yet. On the first el3_exit this register will be overwritten by whatever the outgoing context says and the value above will never be written back. If this bit is necessary for ctx_save/restore, then the short-term solution would be that it should be set somewhere closer to them and el3_exit can overwrite it later. This will also help with refactoring the code for the long-term solution - the root context.",
