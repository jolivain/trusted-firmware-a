      "message": "I seemed to have misunderstood this patch. This is not undoing any EL3 bit setting , but rather removes an optimization which is unnecessary and could have IMPDEF behavior. From that PoV, it is not risky and I dont have any objection .\n\nPerhaps the commit message can reflect that this is removing an optimization which was not needed.",
