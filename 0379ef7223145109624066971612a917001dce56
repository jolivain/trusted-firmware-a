I think using \"core\" as leaf node is not suggested as seen in the example 1 in the page. \nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/cpu/cpu-topology.txt\n\nSo the cluster node might look something like this:\n\ncluster2 {\n\t\t\t\tcore0 {\n\t\t\t\t\tthread0 {\n                                                 cpu \u003d \u003c\u0026CPU8\u003e;\n                                        };\n\t\t\t\t        thread1 {\n\t\t\t\t\t          cpu \u003d \u003c\u0026CPU9\u003e;\n\t\t\t\t        };\n\t\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\tcore1 {\n\t\t\t\t\tthread0 {\n\t\t\t\t\t          cpu \u003d \u003c\u0026CPU10\u003e;\n\t\t\t\t        };\n\t\t\t\t        thread1 {\n\t\t\t\t\t          cpu \u003d \u003c\u0026CPU11\u003e;\n\t\t\t\t        };\n\t\t\t\t};\n};",
