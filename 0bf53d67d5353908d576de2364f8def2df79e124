      "message": "If I\u0027ve understood you correctly, the TE doesn\u0027t just take a single `entry_point_info_t` structure. Instead, we pack all subsequent executable entry point info structures into an array. That means if BL31, or even the runtime firmware in the case of aarch32, has several images to run, we can pass this on in a single TE. In most cases, BL31 unpacks this data and has separate global data structures to keep track of executable state [1].\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/refs/heads/master/plat/arm/common/arm_bl31_setup.c#198",
