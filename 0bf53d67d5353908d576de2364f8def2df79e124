Instead, we pack all subsequent executable entry point info structures into an array. That means if BL31, or even the runtime firmware in the case of aarch32, has several images to run, we can pass this on in a single TE. In most cases, BL31 unpacks this data and has separate global data structures to keep track of executable state [1].\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/refs/heads/master/plat/arm/common/arm_bl31_setup.c#198",

      "message": "Apologies, but I\u0027m not entirely clear on the specific concern here. You are right that `bl_params_t` packs much more information than just the `entry_point_info_t` structure. However, much of this information is discarded once those are retrieved. Although I may be mistaken, I am yet to find any other usage of `bl_params_t`.\n\nThe motivation here is to remove any unnecessary complexity. It doesn\u0027t make sense that we construct the `bl_params_t` structure from scratch when we have all the information we need defined in static structures.\n\nIn practice, this means that if we need to execute BL32 alongside RMM and BL33, we can just get the `entry_point_info_t` structures for those images in BL2 and pack them into a TE of this new type. We can differentiate the `entry_point_info_t` structures in BL31 based on the attribute field of the header [1]. For instance, on Arm platforms BL32 is encoded with the secure flag, and RMM is encoded with a EP_REALM flag [2].\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/refs/heads/master/include/common/ep_info.h#19\n[2] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/refs/heads/master/plat/arm/common/aarch64/arm_bl2_mem_params_desc.c#127",

However, I think currently in the spec we always assume that each TE is with a unique tag ID in the TL, so that we can use this tag ID to identify a TE.\nIf we need to support multiple TEs with a same tag ID, firstly the spec needs to provide a way for how to differentiate the TEs with same tag ID (maybe by adding a new field in the TE header?). Followed by that, some of the APIs need to be redesigned. For example, `transfer_list_find()`.",
