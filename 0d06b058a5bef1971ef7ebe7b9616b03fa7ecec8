      "message": "It is too late, this commit was already merged into integration branch and also into master branch.\n\nAnyway for commit message I have followed rules described in https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#the-canonical-patch-format where length of line should be wrapped at 75 columns. Seems that lot of projects follow this \"75 columns\" and therefore I have configured my editor to autowrap commit messages at this limit. But if TF-A has own style I can change editor. I just did not find information about TF-A style, so I followed rules/style which are common for lot of other projects.",
