      "message": "FYI, I\u0027m adding a test config with measured boot enabled with RME support on FVP:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/14673\n\nI\u0027ve run this patch stack through it. The results are looking good! One can clearly see the prints from the RSS measured boot backend (along side the prints from the TCG event log driver). There are also prints related to RME support. TFTF tests pass successfully.\n\nSee: https://tf.validation.linaro.org/scheduler/job/658636\n(triggered by https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/view/TF-A/job/tf-a-ci-gateway/7697/)",

      "message": "Now, RSS backend perform the hash measurement of the image using mbedTLS crypto backend. IIUC we are calculating hash of single image twice using same backend Cryoto i.e. mbedTLS using RSS and EventLog measured boot backend.\nThis is not concern though (apart from the performance), but to improvise as part of separate patch can we move out the hash measurement from \u003cbackend\u003e_mboot_measure_and_record API?",
