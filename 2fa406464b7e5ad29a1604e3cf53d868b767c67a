      "message": "Hi Leo Yan,\nThanks for your patch. It\u0027s a good add-on for debugging.\n\nCurrently, another refactored patch stack related to the feature detection mechanism is in review.\nFYI: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17869\n\nThis is in the final review phase. \nHere they have introduced a generic function and tried to get rid of trivial feature-specific functions.\nSo, if we get them merged, we might remove the macro.\nfeat_detect_panic(a, b)\t\t((a) ? feature_detected(b) : feature_panic(b))\n\nHowever, your change could be tuned into the generic function check_feature().\nSo could we wait and pull in your changes at the later phase accordingly? \nOr please add your changes on top of this patch stack itself. Either way it\u0027s fine.\n\nLet me know your thoughts here.",
