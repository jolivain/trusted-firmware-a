I wonder whether this is strictly equivalent, the syntax of linker scripts is so complex in my experience, I would not be surprised if it was not subject to the same alignment constraints for example.\n\nCould we replace this line with:\n\n __RW_END__ \u003d __BSS_END__;\n\njust to be on the safe side? __BSS_END__ being defined inside the section, I would expect this to be strictly equivalent.",
