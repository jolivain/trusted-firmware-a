There are multiple venues in the issue tracker and it is confusing where to rise an issue.\n\nI would opt to just the mailing list for general enquiries/enhancement requests as it is more visible and it is the most common way for contributors to interact.\n\nAlso we haven\u0027t sorted out wider question of how to use the phabricator. Hence would prefer to highlight the mailing list for now.",
