      "message": "+1 on this.\n\nI too believe it\u0027s crucial for all platforms utilising SDS to undergo such updates to avoid build failure. In addition to SGI, Juno and Morello, I\u0027ve observed that N1SDP also relies on SDS.\n\nOpting to create individual patches for each platform proves more effective than consolidating everything into a single one from readability perspective. It\u0027s important to note that merging SDS driver changes necessitates concurrent platform changes. Therefore, it\u0027s a more advisable approach to run CI on the complete patch series (by triggering CI on the top patch in the series) rather than triggering CI on intermediate patches.",
