In any case, I don\u0027t think we need to say where we get the config load address and size from. This is abstracted through FCONF and referring to TB_FW_CONFIG sounds confusing to me. Suggest shortening the comment into:\n\n /* Get the config load address and size. */",

Right now, if we  hit one of these in a release build, we will simply see:\n\n Config(s) failed in sanity check\n\nwithout further details... I think these messages should have the same level of verbosity.\n\nAlternatively, if we are worried about inflating release binaries with extra strings, then a hybrid solution could be to save the id of the (last) erroneous config file. That is, replace\n\n bool is_config_sanity_fail \u003d false;\n\nwith\n\n unsigned int error_config_id \u003d MAX_IMAGE_IDS;\n\nand also replace\n\n is_config_sanity_fail \u003d true;\n\nby\n\n error_config_id \u003d config_ids[i];\n\nthen change the final error message into\n\n if (error_config_id !\u003d MAX_IMAGE_IDS)\n   ERROR(\"Invalid config file %u\\n\", error_config_id);\n\nThis won\u0027t provide all details in release builds but it\u0027s a start.",
