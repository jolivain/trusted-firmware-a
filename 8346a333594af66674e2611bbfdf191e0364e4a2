Note that this would also be required to be able to support individual features being enabled/disabled during silicon bringup.\n\nOn the whole, I don\u0027t understand the reasoning behind forcibly disabling using the ID registers for their intended purpose now we *have* runtime probing. Could we set all these to 2 instead? (May still want to do ?\u003d to support local overrides.)",
