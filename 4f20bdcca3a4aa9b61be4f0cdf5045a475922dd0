The tee.elf can\u0027t just be loaded as an ordinary ELF. scripts/gen_tee_bin.py generates binaries that can be loaded, in this case it\u0027s tee-header_v2.bin followed by tee-pager_v2.bin that you need, tee-pageable_v2.bin is just an empty file unless paging is enabled.\n\nThat script converts the relocation information needed for ASLR into a more compact representation. So at boot OP-TEE depends on the processing done by gen_tee_bin.py. Loading tee.elf instead is unsupported and will break if for instance ASLR is enabled.",

      "message": "Is this possibly different for us given that ChromeOS doesn\u0027t use TF-A for all boot stages, but only for the BL3 stage?  I know in our build system, if we bundle OP-TEE into the firmware, then we provide the tee.elf file to be built w/ coreboot and it bundles that in. On boot, when it gets to executing BL32, the contents of the memory for BL32 matches what it would be if I copied the 2 LOAD sections from the ELF file to their corresponding addresses (which is why I implemented it this way where the kernel parses the ELF file and then passes the corresponding LOAD sections to EL3 for execution).\n\nI tried changing things to use the generated tee-header_v2.bin + tee-pager_v2.bin files and get an exception in EL3 once it tries to execute OP-TEE. I can debug OP-TEE startup further if you think this should work to figure out where it\u0027s failing  if you think this should work; but wanted to get your feedback before I spent a bunch of time on that. (OP-TEE doesn\u0027t get to the part where it does it\u0027s normal startup logging when using the bin files)\n\nOr is there more I need to do to prepare OP-TEE for execution when using those bin files? (the TF-A code I was testing w/ is functionally the same as what\u0027s in this change, just added more logging)",

I didn\u0027t discover anything from looking at the qemu_bl2_handle_post_image_load() function unfortunately.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t even appear to be getting into the entry point for OP-TEE from what I can tell ( logging in TF-A right up until it enters OP-TEE is getting hit).\n\nSorry for a naive question (this is the first time I\u0027m touching ASM code in probably 25 years), but I\u0027m assuming the memory contents at the entry point are getting executed first, right?  And those contents should be what\u0027s in __start in entry_a64.S from OP-TEE, right?  https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/203ee23d005b2cec2f21b5de334c5a246be32599/core/arch/arm/kernel/entry_a64.S#L57\n\nBecause if I put an SMC call as the first thing there, it\u0027s not getting hit using the bin loading. (I know my code is right, because if I use the ELF loading technique with the same build of OP-TEE and TF-A, then I can see the logging from my SMC call).\n\nAs a side note, I think I know why it was working with my ELF technique. The code that handles the embedded data and does the relocations here: https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/203ee23d005b2cec2f21b5de334c5a246be32599/core/arch/arm/kernel/entry_a64.S#L104d will end up with a zero size for the relocations, so it wouldn\u0027t bother to do that code and the ELF loading likely put everything in the right spots already so that wasn\u0027t needed. We are buillding without CFG_WITH_PAGER (the platform Makefile for Mediatek indicates it isn\u0027t supported for ARM64).",
