      "message": "Thank you for your comments.\nActually I did both SD boot and eMMC boot test on NXP LS1046ARDB board whose peripheral circuit supports switching signals betwenn SD card and eMMC. Worked fine.\nI kown this is not any standard method, but it benefits developers and users, like current u-boot and linux do.\nPlease let me know if I can help during your tests.\nThanks.",

      "message": "Hi,\n\nI\u0027ve tested the patch and it is not very good for SD-card boot. As CMD1 can loop 100 times, I can see that the boot time increased on STM32MP1 platform (~1second but I didn\u0027t measure it precisely).\nMost of the platforms you\u0027ve changed have a way to determine the boot device, or have only one.\nIf you need to have some detection in the framework, maybe we could add an entry at the beginning of enum mmc_device_type (e.g. MMC_IS_UNKNOWN), and in this case check eMMC or SD, and not touch the platforms code?\n\nRegards,\nYann",
