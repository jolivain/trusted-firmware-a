      "message": "There is a circular dependency here. During cold boot, SPMD makes the call to initialize SPMC, which internally calls FFA_VERSION. FFA_VERSION checks the state and returns \"not supported\". This causes SPMC boot to fail.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think you should remove this check, and this is weakening the individual core SPMC state management. You should definitely have ctx-\u003estate different from RESET at this stage whichever using SPMC at S-EL1 or S-EL2.\n\nIIUC from earlier comments you mentioned Tegra does not use BL32.\nAs said above, it means spmd_init is never called and does not set the default SPMC states, and hence this issue.\n\nThis is normally done this way:\nspmd_setup \u003d\u003e spmd_spmc_init \u003d\u003e bl31_register_bl32_init(\u0026spmd_init);\n\nLater when bl31 inits, spmd_init gets called from bl31_main:\nhttps://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/bl31/bl31_main.c#n132\n\nSo you should find a way to have spmd_init called in some way on this platform provided it does not use the regular code paths to initialize the SPD and secure payload.",
