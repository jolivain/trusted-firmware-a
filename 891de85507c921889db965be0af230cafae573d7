Production (release) build or the debug build (which arguably might have more freedom to be \"less compliant\")? I unfortunately know very little about the TF-A codebase (e.g. how release vs debug code differs), and would like to grow more knowledgeable about it to be able to answer questions like above. In the meantime, I posted https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-job-configs/+/17499, https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-job-configs/+/17500 which allow to specify DEBUG setting (while still keeping default at 0, at least as far as those patches are concerned).",

How is DEBUG specified for a delta job that gets automatically triggered upon Allow-CI+1 ?\n\nMy understanding is that a project is certified as MISRA compliant. I agree it makes sense for release build to be better compliant though I dont see why we cant perform analysis for debug builds. I think its easy to catch issues early in development through assertions before they propagate further.",

So, I cannot assess whether it has a clause like \"Whenever an expression/statement has an unsigned context, any literal constant used in it shall have an \u0027U\u0027 suffix\".\n\nGiven that ECLAIR doesn\u0027t flag this case, and as know, ECLAIR should be pretty thorough in following MISRA (given that people behind ECLAIR are on the MISRA committee), I may conjecture that U suffix is require in expressions when there\u0027s a possibility of mixing signed and unsigned, which in turn can lead to unexpected/undefined behavior. Here\u0027s however an assignment, and there\u0027s no ambiguity - \"0\" alone can fit into an unsigned int variable without any undefined/unpexpected behavior.",
