I believe, this issue is seen consistently with increase in the BL31 file, code size.\n\nThis failure, altogether needs to be resolved separately, and the current patch is not the real cause for it.",

Its a real failure.\n But the failure we are seeing with the arm_fpga platform, is a generic issue. Previously even during release time, we had seen this issue. Its due to memory constraints of the platform. \nWe need to save some memory in order to get through this patch, like we did previously, wherein we saved few bytes via Per_world context patch.",
