I believe, this issue is seen consistently with increase in the BL31 file, code size.\n\nThis failure, altogether needs to be resolved separately, and the current patch is not the real cause for it.",

The build seems to be passing in the daily, and I am able to reproduce the build failures locally for this patch. \n\nhttps://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/3007005\n\nI can\u0027t see any evidence to suggest this is an intermittent failure. Have you managed to produce a successful build for the platform locally?",
