But I don\u0027t think this (recent) feature is used on ST platforms right now, is it, Yann?\n\nIn any case, the measurement operation would not fail and you\u0027d see no error message from TF-A, it\u0027s just that the wrong value would get recorded in boot measurements. Is that something we should capture in the commit message as well?\n\nJust putting my COR+1 against this patch until we resolve this question, the patch per se looks good to me!",
