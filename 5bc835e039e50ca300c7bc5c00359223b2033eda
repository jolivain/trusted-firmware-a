If you take a look at the first rule of the makefile at line 39, any object files resulting from this makefile come straight from assembly files. So I\u0027m not sure if this change has any effect for ROMLIB as the compiler doens\u0027t get invoked inside this makefile.\n\nIt would only make sense to affect the assembler behaviour so if we need any flags we need to touch the ASFLAGS variable, instead. However I don\u0027t know if those flags have any assembler counterpart.",
