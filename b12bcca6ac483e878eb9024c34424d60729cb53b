If STM32_TF_VERSION is not changed, no OTP fuse will be updated. So why would you update this value on a development software? Maybe I miss some information here",

      "message": "Hi Yann,\nThanks for your review and comments.\nI\u0027ve updated the patch according to your input.\n\nWe\u0027re incrementing STM32_TF_VERSION every time we fix a critical security issue to prevent an attacker from exploiting that issue. This effectively prevents anyone from running an old (compromised) version of tf-a on that hardware.\n\nFor development, it can be nice to do have the ability to run older firmware on a non-closed device. Lets say for debugging/reproducing an issue with an older release or if there is an update related issue. \n\nFor that we have non-closed hardware which runs older/previously released firmware just fine and thus allows switching.\n\nExcept.. if the monotonic counter gets fused by the newer firmware. In that case\nthe ROM won\u0027t allow booting older firmware even if the device is open.\nSince rebuilding the firmware with the same (or higher) version will still allow running any unsigned firmware, the counter doesn\u0027t make much sence for an open device.\n\nThat is why I added the conditional.\n\nIt\u0027s not something that is only applicable for DEBUG\u003d1 builds.\n\nI want to prevent developpers from unintentionally fusing the counter value on their development boards. Because for that they only need to boot a recent release once since the value is fused automatically.",
