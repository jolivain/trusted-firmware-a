I was asking about the place where the RFC says that \"The extensions must use all remaining bytes in the TBSCertificate\".\n\nI suppose this might just be because the \"Extensions\" field is the last one in a TBSCertificate sequence, and the ASN.1 grammar does not allow for any padding between fields, as everything is assumed to be consecutive in the absence of a header/top-level metadata?",
