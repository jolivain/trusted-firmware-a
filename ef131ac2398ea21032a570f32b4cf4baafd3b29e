      "message": "Thanks a lot for working on that rk3588 support.\n\nAs for basic functionality I was able to boot into Linux after replacing the binary bl31.elf with one build froms this topic. The other cpu cores also come up.\n\nBut I ran into an issue with cpu frequency scaling.\n\nWith the binary Rockchip bl31, cpufreq seems to work, but when using bl31 built from this topic I get:\n\nOn the 5.10 vendor kernel, with\n[  183.519764] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI Notifications - Core Enabled.\n[  183.520418] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI Protocol v2.0 \u0027rockchip:\u0027 Firmware version 0x0\n\ncpufreq fails on all cores with:\n\n[ 3831.447767] cpu cpu6: cpu_opp_helper: failed to set clk rate: 2304000000 -22\n[ 3831.456181] cpufreq: __target_index: Failed to change cpu frequency: -22\n\n\nAnd on a 6.6-rc kernel with\n[    0.103811] scmi_core: SCMI protocol bus registered\n[    0.203390] scmi_protocol scmi_dev.1: Enabled polling mode TX channel - prot_id:16\n[    0.204654] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI RAW Mode initialized for instance 0\n[    0.205283] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI RAW Mode COEX enabled !\n[    0.205850] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI Notifications - Core Enabled.\n[    0.206470] arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI Protocol v2.0 \u0027rockchip:\u0027 Firmware version 0x0\n\nthere are no errors visible, but an openssl speed check only brings in 1/5th of the speed I got when running the binary bl31 and the cores temperature also doesn\u0027t rise as much ... so it looks like the cpu clocks are also not adjusted there.",
