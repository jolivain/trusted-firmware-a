      "message": "Hi Manish,\n\nThanks for kicking off the CI run! The line ending test in the `tf-a-static-checks` job failed due to the newly added png files in https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17896. From the CI scripts https://git.trustedfirmware.org/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts.git/tree/script/static-checks/static-checks.sh#n65 and https://git.trustedfirmware.org/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts.git/tree/script/static-checks/static-checks-coding-style-line-endings.sh#n19, I see that we\u0027re not filtering for source and doc files in CI runs. I can go ahead and update static-checks-coding-style-line-endings.sh to account for this or is this something we can manually override?\n\nThanks!\nWing",
