      "message": "The name of the API and this description may be misleading.  They read as if it should return the total size of the regions being protected, whereas I presume it is the size of the region descriptors array that should be returned instead.\n\nI cannot find a site where this API is being called.  Is it meant to be called when calculating the DLME data space requirement for the Protected Regions table, or when advertising region-based memory protection via DRTM_FEATURES?",
