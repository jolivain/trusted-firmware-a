      "message": "Because \"poetry will handle\" raises more questions to me that it answers about how. If you say something like \"`poetry install` will create a virtual environment (unless you\u0027re already in one, in which case it will use that instead) and install ...\" it becomes quite clear I think. Personally, I\u0027d put the note just after this bit to answer the where question, but now that it\u0027s just after the first use, I suppose that\u0027s fair enough.\n\nAgain, we\u0027re forcing the user to use poetry, so we ought to teach them the very basics of using it (poetry install with/without venv; poetry run for single command in the venv; poetry shell for anyone used to old-style venvs). The feeback we got when I rewrote this section boiled down to \"noone reads the notes\" let alone any external links that would be \"extra\".",

I think it makes sense to frame that information in the context of how the documentation is built. I have made some changes to make the essentials clear for the common use cases. With this in mind I\u0027ve also removed in the installation instructions for poetry from the prerequisites. How to install it is very well documented along with some basic use cases. Developers should have the flexibility to install it however they feel is most appropriate. Its simple enough not to warrant us duplicating that information from the official docs.",
