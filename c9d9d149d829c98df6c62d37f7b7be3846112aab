      "message": "I am a bit confused after reading the TRM. If I understood the GICR_PWRR register bit definitions correctly, I think gicr_write_pwrr() must be executed before gicr_wait_group_not_in_transit() function. Here is why: At reset, Redistributors are considered to be powered down. Hence by executing gicr_write_pwrr(), we set the \"intention\"(RDGPD) to power up (\u003d0) which has to match with the actual state (RDGPO). Once they are same, we check if Redistributor has accepted the request and has been powered down (RDPD\u003d\u003d0).",
