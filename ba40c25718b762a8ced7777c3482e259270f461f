      "message": "This inclusion is mainly done to resize [1] the BL2 maximum size depends upon the MBedTLS key algorithm chosen. This is change is not really related to DRTM implementation. This change been added to make use of MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE flag consistently in the source code, hence we merged it separately. Let me take this change out from the DRTM topic.\n\nComing back to your comment, initial plan is to support DRTM on FVP platform with MBedTLS as crypto backend. We plan to use all Crypto generic APIs to do the hash calculation of various components coming in the DRTM process (that eventually will call platform\u0027s registered crypto callbacks).\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/14532/6/plat/arm/board/juno/include/platform_def.h#144",
