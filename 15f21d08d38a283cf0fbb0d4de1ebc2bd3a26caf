      "message": "Well, but this is *subtracting* 8, so I think this is really not the case for the MISRA rule here - at least it sounds quite weird to do essentially \"count -\u003d +8\". Did the checker actually complain about that?\nRule 7.2 seems to speak of \"integer constants represented in an unsigned type\" - whatever that means, really, but I read it as not being the case here.",
