The ``linux/fs.h`` and ``sys/ioctl.h`` headers are not included in fiptool.c, so I\u0027m wondering how this has been compiled (looks like those are explicitly include while compiling this tool for example ``gcc -include \u003cheader-file\u003e``. \nI\u0027m just speculating at this point, so I\u0027ll let Antonio weigh in on this.
