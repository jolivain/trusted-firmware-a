      "message": "Hi Olivier,\n\nYes, and David is already looking into this. Copying here for reference an excerpt of our discussion:\n\n\u003e The build error is happening due to the missing definitions of PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1 and PSA_ALG_SHA_256 (coming from psa/crypto_types.h and psa/crypto_values.h). It needs mbedTLS to be included for the required headers - when MEASURED_BOOT\u003d1 it is working.\n\u003e \n\u003e However, the fvp_realm_attest.key file is added to the build with ENABLE_RME\u003d1, MEASURED_BOOT is not required at the moment.\n\nThe solution we agreed on is:\n\n\u003e Only add this .c file to the build if both  MEASURED_BOOT and ENABLE_RME are enabled. The reason behind this is that it doesn\u0027t make too much sense to use the delegated attestation API without measured boot support.\n\nAnd this solution will be supported by the following internal patch, which I believe David will soon post on the public Gerrit:\n\nhttps://gerrit.oss.arm.com/c/pdcs-platforms/ap/tf-topics/+/262208\n\nThis internal patch enforces a dependency between ENABLE_RME and MEASURED_BOOT build options: if ENABLE_RME is enabled, MEASURED_BOOT will be forcefully enabled.",
