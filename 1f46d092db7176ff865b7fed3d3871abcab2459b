      "message": "I would rather phrase it as something like:\n\n reduce the number of cpu libraries included by default\n\nbecause when I initially read this, I thought we were throttling the number of emulated CPUs and restrict the platform topology.\n\nThis headline will appear in the changelog so that\u0027s why I am raising it.\n\nAlso, I would argue that this is not a fix() but rather a build() change. Looking at the commit style documentation [1], the \"build\" scope is for \"Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\", which seems more appropriate to me.\n\n[1] https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/commit-style.html",
