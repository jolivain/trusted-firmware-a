Kindly ensure these newly added source files are covered by : \n   a. Coverity scan analysis by adding them to \"tf-cov-make\" build script with the appropriate build configurations. \n   b. Built as part of one of the platform configurations present in \"tf-l1-build-plat\" test group.\n\n   Please refer to the tf-a documentation for more detailed explanation. \n   \"https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html#add-build-configurations\"\n\"",
