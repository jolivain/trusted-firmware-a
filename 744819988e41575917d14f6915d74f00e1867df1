But is the point you\u0027re making that we should prevent people from commenting on this page on the first instance, or at least put some stricter restrictions on it, like requesting them to have an account on tf.org?",

I think we wan\u0027t people to be able to post comments on the page to give feedback, so disabling commenting altogether sounds like a bad idea to me on second thoughts.\n\nI guess the best we can do is subscribing to the page (which a couple of us have done already), which should send us notifications if some inappropriate comment is posted, and delete it afterwards (which is probably what Joanna did).",
