      "message": "The patch itself looks alright, I verified with \"sed\" that\u0027s a pure rename.\nHowever I think the new name is as made-up as the old one: there is no FEAT_SYS_REG_TRACE anywhere in the ARM ARM. There is actually no FEAT_ name at all for this feature. I\u0027d suggest to stay close to the DFR0 field name, which is \"FieldVer\". That is admittedly a bad name as well, but at least something the can be found in the ARM ARM, for reference.\nOpen to other suggestions here.",

      "message": "Hi Andre,\nI have shared you the confluence with the details/discussions on the naming pattern being followed.\n\nAgree that we dont have a feature name as SYS_REG_TRACE in Arm ARM.\n\nThis is part of trace unit such as ETMv4.x, and ETE(extending ETM feature).\nSo either we could rename them with these names or just ENABLE_SYS_REG_TRACE. \n\nLet me know your thoughts. Lets hear from other reviewers as well.",

      "message": "I would be on board with renaming it to ENABLE_FEAT_ETM(v4.x) or ENABLE_FEAT_ETE.\n\nThe reason why I included the keyword FEAT is because the flag takes a value from 0 to 2 to align with the FEATURE_DETECTION mechanism, as mentioned in the confluence page.",
