      "message": "The patch itself looks alright, I verified with \"sed\" that\u0027s a pure rename.\nHowever I think the new name is as made-up as the old one: there is no FEAT_SYS_REG_TRACE anywhere in the ARM ARM. There is actually no FEAT_ name at all for this feature. I\u0027d suggest to stay close to the DFR0 field name, which is \"FieldVer\". That is admittedly a bad name as well, but at least something the can be found in the ARM ARM, for reference.\nOpen to other suggestions here.",
