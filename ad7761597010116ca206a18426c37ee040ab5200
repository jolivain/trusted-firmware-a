      "message": "Hi,\nThis patch will conflict with the patch:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/27997\nAnd it seems to do almost the same thing. Which one is the correct one? One of the 2 patches may be abandoned then.\nThe patch also conflicts with other Intel platforms patches. Could you make a series with all the patches, as some patches may depend on other ones.\nThanks",
