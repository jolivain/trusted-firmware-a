      "message": "So this is a little roundabout, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s wrong: (this interpretation of) the PCS says that any function may use x15 as it wants. So the reset_func uses x10 through x15 to save things, which is compliant. So any code in the reset_func may safely use x0 through x9, which is stated in its comment. Knowing this, the _workaround_start uses x8 to save things and lets its body use x0 through x7. \n\nSo workarounds do reflect the reset_func constraint which reflects the PCS constraint, but the PCS doesn\u0027t need to reflect theirs.",

      "message": "I see what you mean now. I suppose it was unclear to me that \"CPU functions\" as referred to here applies at the top-level (not just to workarounds/checkers) and then further restrictions sort of trickle down as you go further down the call chain. \n\nAs a reader reading what I interpreted as documentation specific to the framework, I was reading \"CPU functions\" as the workaround/checker functions specifically, ie things that a user of the framework would be implementing. \n\nI think my main issue is if someone wants to add an errata using the new macros, they probably will be starting bottom up. IE they wont be looking at how the macros are implemented, how the reset function is implemented etc. The comments indicating the standard they need to adhere to aren\u0027t in the place where the user is writing new code. So it seems very easy for someone to write a new errata (or in my case convert an old one) not noticing that they are making this mistake. I think the documentation could help mitigate that risk by addressing this use case more explicitly/in more detail.\n\nAs you say, it is not that your documentation is wrong, it is that it is roundabout and I think it can be made more clear to avoid issues like the one I ran into in the future.",

I wonder if maybe still some comment could be added to this section along the lines of \"all CPU functions should adhere to this PCS but further restrictions may be imposed by the errata framework functions\" \n\nie these are the ones that are available in general, but the framework reserves some of the scratch registers for its own use.",
