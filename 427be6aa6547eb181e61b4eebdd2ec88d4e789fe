I\u0027m not quite sure why the error are getting triggered here. This is the reason I called it out as false positive. Could you please help me understand if these are genuine issues?\n\nWrt to lint issues - how do we add new scope? rdfremont and neoverse_rd should be scopes that we would using going forward. We\u0027ll fix the issues with respect to\n\n1. starting the subject with a verb\n2. making sure nothing starts in caps\n\nWrt to CI companion change, would it be okay if we work on this after getting this patchset merged.
