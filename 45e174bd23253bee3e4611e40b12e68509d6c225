      "message": "i dont htink this should be removed for drtm..even for folks who simply want to run and test, it is best that thye know and enable trusted boot, and know that running without trusted boot would compromise integrity of DCRTM.\nAlso not sure the following statement is accurate. Trusted boot is only required to ensure integrity of the DCRTM no?\nseems weird that you need authenticated boot to trust data provided by dce preamble, which is untrusted..",
