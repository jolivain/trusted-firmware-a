So if anything, perhaps we should add a new threat in the generic threat model.\n\nThe new threat could cover the DoS aspect (leaving the system in an inconsistent way). This is not covered by threat #1 today, which focuses on what an attacker could gain by replacing the firmware by a custom one that would do useful things for them. Another angle is to consider what an attacker could gain by replacing the firmware by a broken one (which does not do anything useful or specific, it just does not boot).\n\nI don\u0027t quite know whether this should be added in threat #1, or create a new threat altogether. I guess one difference would be that this new threat would target the \"Availability\" asset, in addition to the \"Code execution\" asset. The threat types also would be different: denial of service but no elevation of privilege.
