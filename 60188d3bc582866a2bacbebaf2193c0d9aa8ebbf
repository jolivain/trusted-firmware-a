      "message": "can you update commit message? cannot tell what issue it is fixing. The fix doesnt make sense because we are going from using the priority for a given event in SDEI to a hard coded value. That does not seem right...What if RAS_PRI is lower than the event priority for example?",

Do an EOI of the RAS interrupt before SDEI was dispatch. The core may be preempted by another RAS\ninterrupt While dispatch SDEI. After the second RAS handle finished(include dispatch SDEI), the first RAS\u0027s dispatch  will failed with return -1.\n\nI think there was a problem about RAS flow and dispatch SDEI. As sdei_dispatch_event() was call only in RAS flow, so i modify simply it to a hard coded value.\n\nsgi_ras_intr_configure():\n...\n\t/*\n\t * Do an EOI of the RAS interrupt.
