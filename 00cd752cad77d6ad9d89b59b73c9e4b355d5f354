      "message": "This code block executes in cold boot. \nPreviously, during cold boot, the primary CPU gets its context initialised for NS and later on -\u003e SECURE world.\nIn this path, if we have Secure component running at S-EL2(CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS) present, then we initialise SCTLR_EL2 register in setup_ns_context function and this will be used to while we switch to NS later on, wherein NS context gets restored.\n\nIn build configs, wherein we don\u0027t have S-EL2 (SPMC), here we use the SCTLR_EL1 value to configure SCTLR_EL2 register, as we have a software component at NS-EL2, but not at S-EL2.\n\nWith this, the problem is we cannot decouple EL1 and EL2 context, which is our primary goal.\n\nHence I thought of having a global value for configuring this register, as it\u0027s just the initial configuration. With this I dont need to rely on EL2 register context, to configure EL1 register.\n\nHope this provides some overview and the reason behind this patch.",

Agree with you, just was thinking `sctlr_el2_endian_val` doesn\u0027t fully now represent the entire value of `sctlr_el2` when we do `write_sctlr_el2`.\n\nWas just worrying(maybe unnecessarily 😊) are we overwriting any default values from Power on Reset(POR) certain regs are configured to hold default values on POR and we overwrite any default values we may be overriding any default behavior.",
