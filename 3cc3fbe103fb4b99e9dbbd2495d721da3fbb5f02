Perhaps I missed that bit of discussion, but it feels a little inconsistent with the hook doing it internally.\n\nMy thinking is that it\u0027s a thing to forget when using the enable/disable and code outside of CTX management will need to do it (like spe_disable).",

      "message": "Yeah, I am not convinced of that either, but if I got Soby correctly, he wanted it that way. On the plus side we save the not-so-nice stubbing in the header file: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/18992/2/include/lib/extensions/trbe.h\nSo this is one question I hoped to get some comments on. The other one is whether we want to have extra checks in the functions. I dropped them here, for this version, since they are now somewhat redundant, but we could put them back, just to be consistent and more future-proof.\nSoby, can you say what you think of this?",
