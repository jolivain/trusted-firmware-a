If the image loader cannot load images bigger than 4GB then I don\u0027t see the point for fconf to cater for config files bigger than that. 4GB should be more than enough for config files anyway.\n\nI am not requesting this to be changed as part of this patch but it would be good to write it down somewhere, in some list of remaining fconf cleanups.",
