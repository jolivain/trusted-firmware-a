My understanding is that:\n* If the certificate has no nvcounter extension, it means that it is not rollback-protected so the firmware should not attempt to do any nvcounter checks.\n* If the certificate has a nvcounter extension with value 0, it means that the certificate version is 0 and so the firmware should cross-check this value with the one in the hardware.\n\nThese are 2 different things and not equivalent at all. I think we want the first behaviour, i.e. the existing code was fine. (I am not talking about the fix for the hash at line 510, which I think is needed).",
