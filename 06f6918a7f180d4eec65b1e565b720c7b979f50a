This function plat_setup_try_img_ops() is just there to register the platform ops (I\u0027ll add that here too).\nFor the PSA FWU, you\u0027re right this should be clearer, especially after I removed some comments when removing plat_try_next_boot_source() in the previous patch. I may add them (or some of them) back in common/bl_common.c",
