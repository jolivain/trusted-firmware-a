      "message": "Hi Mario,\n\nYes, it is `kernel_address\u003d` indeed. I made the mistake in the commit message.\n\nI checked this again and behavior is quite interesting: loader indeed prints the correct address:\n\n```\nLoading \u0027kernel_2712.img\u0027 to 0x00000000 offset 0x2000000\n```\n\nBut in fact, kernel image is located at 0x200000. I checked this with hardware debugger. This can also be verified due to this error message:\n```\n[    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory for node \u0027optee_core@80000\u0027: base 0x0000000000080000, size 32 MiB\n```\n\nWhen I am moving OP-TEE away from memory beginnig, this message disappears.\n\nAlso, RPI documentation says that `kernel_address` is a legacy option and is not supported anymore.",
