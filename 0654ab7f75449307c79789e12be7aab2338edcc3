Coverity scan analysis by adding them to \"tf-cov-make\" build script with the appropriate build configurations. \n   b. Built as part of one of the platform configurations present in \"tf-l1-build-plat\" test group.\n\nOnce that is done post the CI patch gerrit review link here and I can review and hopefully MR this and possibly the other patches in this stack assuming all other review issues are resolved.",
