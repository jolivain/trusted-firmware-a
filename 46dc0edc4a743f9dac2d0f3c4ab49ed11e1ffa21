      "message": "Unfortunately we missed explicitly setting the dependency as optional in the original change. This meant that documentation dependencies were always installed by Poetry. I\u0027ve modified the poetry configuration so that these have to be explicitly installed with: `poetry install --with docs`. I\u0027ve also renamed the group name as the current name is a tad unconventional (we\u0027ve had to fix the name a few times now).",
