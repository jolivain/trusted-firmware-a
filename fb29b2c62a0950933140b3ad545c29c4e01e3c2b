      "message": "Hi Tamas,\n\nThe OID header files in [1] and [2] relate to TBBR and CCA, respectively. If the DPE is applicable to a CCA-enabled system, it would be advisable to update the OID header in accordance with CCA, referring to [2].\nIf it is applicable for both (TBBR and CCA) then leave this as it is.\n\n[1]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/include/tools_share/tbbr_oid.h\n[2]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/include/tools_share/cca_oid.h",
