Also I compared the new files to their respective rpi4 counterparts, and that looks reasonable. I compared the MMIO base addresses of the peripherals against the DT found in the RPiOS github: they match, except I cannot find anything in the DT for RPI4_LOCAL_CONTROL_BASE_ADDRESS, but I assume that\u0027s fine.",
