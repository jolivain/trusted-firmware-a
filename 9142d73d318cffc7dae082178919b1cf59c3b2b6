To me this comment implies this is the only place where these are set. Is it meant to mean that they are only not context switched?\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, wouldn\u0027t it be a more useful change to have a way of tracing where these get modified? I struggle to see the benefit of this and the problem it\u0027s trying to solve.",
