      "message": "Pauth (in lib/extensions/pauth/pauth_helpers.S) changes a field in SCTLR_EL3 and some other extensions change fields for MDCR_EL3. To me this comment implies this is the only place where these are set. Is it meant to mean that they are only not context switched?\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, wouldn\u0027t it be a more useful change to have a way of tracing where these get modified? I struggle to see the benefit of this and the problem it\u0027s trying to solve.",

      "message": "This patch is in series of changes which will improve the readability/traceability of EL3 registers.\nThis patch is helping in dividing registers in 2 categories\n1. Registers which have a single value during all execution context\n2. Registers which have different values per world. (In future when we introduce root context will use this set of registers)\n\nAbout pauth_init_enable_el3 function, it inits the key and enable pauth (in sctlr_el3), we can move enable part in this function itself.",
