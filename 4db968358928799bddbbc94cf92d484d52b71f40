      "message": "Sorry about the delay, Ive been OoO for the past month.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t think this has any effect on EFI based systems with linux since it should be deleting this node anyway (AFAIK) and edk2 is building its own memmap without DT. I can\u0027t comment on the *BSD\u0027s or what uboot might be doing with this node.\n\nOTOH, I don\u0027t really understand the size check behavior here (the couple FTD\u0027s I have lying about all have addr\u003d0, size\u003d4k). It brings up the question of what happens if someone has a future/past DT where this isn\u0027t a subset of the shared-dma-pool reservation. It seems to me that this code should really be stricter about removing this node and only remove if its addr\u003d0 size\u003d4k and ignore all other regions.",
