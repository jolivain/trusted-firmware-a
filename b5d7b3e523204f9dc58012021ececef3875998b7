      "message": "The empty #ifdef branch here is just to avoid negative logic, it gets filled in a later patch. Will change the name of the symbol.\nAnd naturally this is not platform specific, so I didn\u0027t want to unnecessarily tie this to a certain platform. Other later platforms might use this as well, and we *could* even think about moving the A64 to DRAM, which would lift our tight SRAM limit and would allow us to properly protect TF-A\u0027s memory on every board.",
