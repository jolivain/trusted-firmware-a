      "message": "Hi Lauren,\n\nI\u0027ve observed that the patch is introducing modifications to alter the function parameter, particularly by now passing the complete GPT header to be filled with data, instead of retrieving the starting LBA of the array of partition entries. To enhance the clarity and maintain a more organized structure, I suggest splitting this patch into two distinct parts-\n\nPatch 1: Return Full GPT Header instead of part_lba\nThis part of the patch focuses on adjusting the function to return the entire GPT header rather than just the part_lba. \n\nPatch 2: Calculate Partition Entries CRC and Verify Against Stored CRC\nThe patch is dedicated to calculating the CRC for the partition entries and subsequently comparing it with the stored CRC. \n\nBy breaking down the changes into these two specific patches, the overall readability will be improved, making it easier for both developers and reviewers to understand and evaluate each modification independently.\n\nLet me know what do you think?",
