      "message": "Agreed, reverted. In this case it actually just fits within the line limit so there is no problem. \n\nUnfortunately I had originally tried the proposed split line approach however this causes the linter to thrown warnings. After a discussion offline in other cases where line length is an issue it seems that it might be the \"least bad\" option to exceed the line length as opposed to splitting the line. \n\nDo you have a strong preference either way?",
