      "message": "what do you mean? There will be no change in behaviour with this change, just a semantic change that will change reporting.\n\nIf you mean we should say ERRATA_APPLIES when it doesn\u0027t necessarily but we\u0027ve applied a workaround for implementation details, then no. This is a limitation in the errata setup I suppose. It hasn\u0027t mattered so far as reporting has been exclusively a debug feature. However, with the errata abi this is no longer the case. Once the framework is integrated with it, the return of this function will directly influence what we tell the kernel. And I argued offline that telling it \"this cpu is affected by this erratum\" is clearly wrong when it doesn\u0027t.",
