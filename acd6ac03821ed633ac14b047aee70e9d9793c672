      "message": "This is a good step to make this implementation of memchr() more aligned with the ISO C standard but I think we need one more.\n\nThe standard says:\n\n The memchr function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to an unsigned\n char) in the initial n characters (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object\n pointed to by s.\n\nThis patch takes care of interpreting each character of the string as an unsigned char. Now we also need to cast \u0027c\u0027 into an unsigned char to make it fully compliant.\n\nSee FreeBSD\u0027s implementation for example: https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/lib/libc/string/memchr.c#L50",
