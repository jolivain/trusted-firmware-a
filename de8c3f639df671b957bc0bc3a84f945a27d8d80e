      "message": "Hi Raghu, thanks for your comment!\n\nAgree, certificates contain critical information, but not all the information is critical in the certificate. for example, hashes of images don\u0027t seem like critical data.\nWe are still analysing what critical information is present in the certificate, accordingly will collect that into some structure, and measure it separately rather than measuring the whole certificate. As of now not sure how complex it is to implement in this way.\nPlease let me know your opinion about this approach, anything else in your mind?",

Do you think apart from certificates and images, anything else is critical in your platform that needs to be measured? \nAnswers to the above question will help us in code designing to measure and report such data.",
