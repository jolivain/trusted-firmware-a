On the boot core, we don\u0027t need the linear ID early, we could do the FFA call to get the linear ID a bit later.",

That is a fair point but as you say I would expect S-EL0 SPs to continue using option 2. TBH, I had not considered a S-EL0 SP requirement so thanks for pointing it out.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on adding it to the FF-A spec? It would lessen ambiguity from a SP perspective. However, I am not sure if using an entire register for passing the index is fair. Wondering if reserving 8-bits in a register should be adequate. 255 entries, even sparsely populated should be adequate?",

Generally, for things that are IMPDEF, it would be good to have one spec defined method and while allowing the same to be IMPDEF as well.\n8-bits may be a bit short. We already have 96 core multi-socket servers in the market (Cavium) so \u003e 256 core systems are not too far away in the future. So 16 bits should be a safe bet for a while.
