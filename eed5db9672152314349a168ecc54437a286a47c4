      "message": "Actually I don\u0027t think we need this patch. The build system can continue using strings of the form PLATFORM_TEST\u003drss-nv-counters, so long as it converts this into the appropriate \"-D macro\" flag when compiling TF-A source code (which it does already). I don\u0027t see anything wrong with that, and in fact I much prefer typing \u0027make PLATFORM_TEST\u003drss-nv-counters\u0027 rather than \u0027make PLATFORM_TEST_NV_COUNTERS\u003d1\u0027.\n\nDid I miss anything? Is this fixing actually fixing a build issue?",
