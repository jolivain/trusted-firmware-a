      "message": "Hi Manish,\n\nYour understanding regarding the first two patches in the series is correct. \nAs discussed offline, the first patch in the series provides initial settings of trap bits irrespective of whether the feature is supported in architecture or not, and the second patch enables feature registers access to lower NS ELs, hence retained these patches as separate. I have updated comments/commit-message for patches in this series to make it more clear.\nPlease review the updated patch series. Thanks!",
