That is the SUCCESS vs 0 parameters where I\u0027m clearing a field which isn\u0027t the SMC return code and the slight style issue, which I understand was sorta on the fence to begin with (and I\u0027m following the lkml style). The SMC_RET calls with 0 as the return code have been updated to use SUCCESS as asked though. While maybe a bit subtle, the code is now differentiating the return code from fields being cleared.\n\n\n",
