      "message": "Hi Igor,\nThanks for your patch.\nEtienne forwarded me your mail explaining your change.\n\nOverall, the patch the patch looks OK excepts the place you use in the register (I\u0027ve made some remarks inline), and some minor other things.\nBe also aware, that by default, this register is writable by non-secure world. But this can of course be configured, as Etienne said.\n\nBest regards,\nYann",

Maybe just replace all occurrences of itf in the 2 functions with boot_status?",
