Hence, I feel its better to declare the function as inline.\nBy the way, did you notice a reduction in binary size with this patch?",

      "message": "You are correct that in the end the compiler has the final say. Putting this inline tag *does* influence that decision.\n\nHere there is no good reason to try to influence that decision, there is nothing gained from these function being inline. And yes, I do see the compiler takes the hint and does inline these functions, which only increases binary size and reduces performance, a negative gain.\n\nWithout the inline hint here the compiler makes the correct and *better* choice of not inlining.",
