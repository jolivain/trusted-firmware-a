      "message": "I don\u0027t have the final inputs about this. And it really depends on what is the boot scheme Marek wants to use. From what I understood, the goal is to get rid of BL32 (OP-TEE in this case), so have nothing running at S-EL1. And BL33 (U-Boot) and then Linux would run at NS-EL1.\n@Marex, is it stil the case?\nIf so then the change needs to be done in BL2, which as said before is not ST recommendation. That said, the change is limited and under a flag, that is disabled by default.\n@Marex, if you still want this boot scheme, could you rebase your patch, and put the modified code at the end of the function bl2_el3_plat_prepare_exit()? No need to remove security during the execution of TF-A, it is just required for the next stage.",
