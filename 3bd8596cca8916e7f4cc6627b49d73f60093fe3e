That said, this is not the role of BL2 to manage the platform security, this should be done by BL32 (OP-TEE for STM32MP13). BL2 should only deal with what is needed for its use if talking about security features.\n\nAfter seeing your patch, I\u0027ve sent a series to move the MCKPROT to BL32 (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/27320). It was waiting for its OP-TEE counter part that is now merged.",
