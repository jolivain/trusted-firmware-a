      "message": "Hi Madhu,\nIn one of the previous comments on previous verison of this patch, Govind suggested to alter within the function than adding #ifs at all the places where we use\n``cm_el1_sysregs_context_restore``.\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/28744/19/lib/el3_runtime/aarch64/context_mgmt.c#1802\n\nHence I modified it. I am open to suggestions and ok with either ways.\nI thought the approach of having #if and #else within the function was good as well. Hence I modified.\nLet me know your thoughts. I pushed this version to get to know the opinions from all the reviewers and based on it finalise the approach.",
