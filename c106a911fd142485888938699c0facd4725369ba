      "message": "Hi Madhu,\nIn one of the previous comments on previous verison of this patch, Govind suggested to alter within the function than adding #ifs at all the places where we use\n``cm_el1_sysregs_context_restore``.\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/28744/19/lib/el3_runtime/aarch64/context_mgmt.c#1802\n\nHence I modified it. I am open to suggestions and ok with either ways.\nI thought the approach of having #if and #else within the function was good as well. Hence I modified.\nLet me know your thoughts. I pushed this version to get to know the opinions from all the reviewers and based on it finalise the approach.",

I will modify it in the next version of patch.\n\nJFYI: I had similar thoughts, that from the readability point of view, when we see the code, its kind of misleading even though its handled internally. \nBut from the implementation point of view, the other approach had some pros as we limited the usage of #ifs and #else etc. \nI wanted to compare them around and get an opinion from the reviewers, which is clear now.\n\nI will modify it.\nThanks!",
