      "message": "it\u0027s worth mentioning that my confusion comes from the \"child components\", implying a tree structure.\n\nIf there is such a tree structure, than this directly contradicts the single-use property of the context handle.\n\nIf what you meant is that there are a sequence of components that execute one at a time, with each component passing a valid context handle to the next in line, I would reword this. Something like \"All subsequent components receive a context handle from the prior component\", and/or including a baton passing analogy would help",
