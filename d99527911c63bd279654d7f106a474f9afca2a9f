      "message": "For the record, ULL macro was introduced by this patch to correct an issue with GCC-6:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/9edac0479d562a5cb62b57961ad6288d0537e9f1\nThe issue cannot be reproduced since GCC-7, but I couldn\u0027t find any info about this in GCC changelog.\n\nMaybe those macros could then be removed in all the TF-A code, but that would be a huge work.\nWe also need to be sure that old gcc version are no more used. I know that there is a ticket for GCC-7 (https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/T999).\nAnd as I said in my previous reviews (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/16814/5#message-7f965833a232708ac843c20cabedd35c815e321a) this should be checked with other maintainers.\n\nSo for me those changes should be OK, but I still think that the parentheses are useless and should be removed.",
