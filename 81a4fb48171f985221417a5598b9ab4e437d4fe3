      "message": "So (just checking) I gather you\u0027re saying that PTP3_CFG1_CPU_START_ID is #defined as zero, and is very unlikely to ever be redefined as anything else?\n\nJust an idea:  If there is any meaningful chance of it ever being #defined to other than zero, then perhaps add a comment to mention that, if PTP3_CFG1_CPU_START_ID \u003e 0, then this code must be guarded with that conditional to that effect?  Otherwise it would be easy to forget to do so.",
