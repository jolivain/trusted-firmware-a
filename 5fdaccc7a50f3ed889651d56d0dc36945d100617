      "message": "Hi Sandrine,\nYes that\u0027s easy, you just need to add CC\u003dsparse in your make command line.\nSometimes you may have false positive, so I usually run it with CC\u003d\"sparse --arch\u003darm --gcc-base-dir\u003d$TOOLCHAINS/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi -D__ARM_ARCH -D__ELF__\", as it is aarch32. I can check an aarch64 with an FVP platform if all those options are required.\nIt could be a good idea to add it to the OpenCI. Most of the things I find now are in extra libs (zlib, compiler-rt...).",
