Kernel people arrived at the consensus that this should be done in the secure firmware (http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2017-March/496864.html).\n\nAlso please note that rcar platforms already do something similar.",

      "message": "OK, this means that all SErrors are now routed to EL3 and kernel has no visibility of them anymore. If there were some errors which could have been `handled` by kernel (as in closing the misbehaving application or shutting down a device), that will not happen and the system will panic in EL3. \n\nIdeally you need to signal the SError back to kernel from EL3 using SDEI or inject the SError to the lower EL and the kernel can decide to die or not.",
