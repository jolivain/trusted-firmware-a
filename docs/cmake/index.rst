Build System Manual
===================

These pages describe the CMake based build system which will replace the legacy
make based one. For information on why and how the legacy build system is
replaced please refer to `this WIKI page`_ and
the :ref:`TF-A CMake Build System Proposal` section of this document.

The documentation is split to two main parts. The :ref:`Build System Concepts`
captures the architecture, and the :ref:`Build System Users Guide` captures
implementation and usage specific topics.

The :ref:`TF-A CMake Build System Proposal` and the :ref:`Build System Concepts`
chapters contain parallel content. The proposal is kept for historical reasons
and if there is discrepancy the Build system manual takes precedence.

.. warning::

  The new build system is work in progress and is not ready for production work.
