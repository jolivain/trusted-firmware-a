TFA_ERRATA_DSU_936184
=====================

.. default-domain:: cmake

.. variable:: TFA_ERRATA_DSU_936184

This applies errata 936184 workaround for the affected |DSU| configurations.
This errata applies only for those DSUs that contain the ACP interface
**and** the DSU revision is older than r2p0 (on r2p0 it is fixed). However,
please note that this workaround results in increased DSU power consumption
on idle.
