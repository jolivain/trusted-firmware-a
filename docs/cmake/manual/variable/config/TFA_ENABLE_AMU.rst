.. default-domain:: cmake

.. variable:: TFA_ENABLE_AMU

Enables Activity Monitor Unit extensions. This is an optional
architectural feature available on Armv8.4-A onwards. Some Armv8.2-A
implementations also implement an AMU and this option can be used to enable
this feature on those systems as well.

Disabled by default.
