CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
====================

.. default-domain:: cmake

.. variable:: CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

Path to the toolchain file supplied to :manual:`cmake(1) <manual:cmake(1)>`. See
:variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE <variable:CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.

While fully supported, it's generally inadvisable to provide this manually.
Instead, prefer to use one of the pre-packaged toolchains available through the
:variable:`TFA_TOOLCHAIN` option.
