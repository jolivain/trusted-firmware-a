TFA_PLATFORM_TOOLCHAINS
==============

.. default-domain:: cmake

.. variable:: TFA_PLATFORM_TOOLCHAINS

A list of toolchains supported by the platform. These correspond to the
filenames of the toolchain files in the ``toolchains`` directories found at the
root of the project, and optionally at the root of the platform.

Each platform is expected to define this in its :ref:`Platform Metadata` file.
