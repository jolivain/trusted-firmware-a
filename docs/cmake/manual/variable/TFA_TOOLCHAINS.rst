TFA_TOOLCHAINS
==============

.. default-domain:: cmake

.. variable:: TFA_TOOLCHAINS

    A list of toolchains supported by the platform. These correspond to the
    filenames of the toolchain files in the ``toolchains`` directories found at
    the root of the project, and optionally at the root of the platform.

    Each platform is expected to define this in its :ref:`Platform Metadata`
    file.
