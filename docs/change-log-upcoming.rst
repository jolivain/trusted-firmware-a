New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Arm Architecture
   - Add support for Armv8.4-SecEL2 extension through the SPCI defined SPMD/SPMC
     components.
   - Build option to support EL2 context save and restore in the secure world
     (CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS).
   - Example: "Add support for Branch Target Identification (BTI)"

- BL-specific
   - Enhanced BL2 bootloader flow to load secure partitions based on firmware
     configuration data (fconf).

- Build System
   - Add support for documentation build as a target in Makefile
   - Add ``COT`` build option to select the chain of trust to use when the
     Trusted Boot feature is enabled (default: ``tbbr``).
   - Added creation and injection of secure partition packages into the FIP.
   - Build option to support SPMC component loading and run at S-EL1
     or S-EL2 (SPMD_SPM_AT_SEL2).

- CPU Support
   - Example: "cortex-a55: Workaround for erratum 1221012"
   - Use Speculation Barrier instruction for v8.5+ cores

- Drivers
   - Example: "console: Allow the console to register multiple times"

- Libraries
   - Example: "Introduce BTI support in Library at ROM (romlib)"

   - plat/arm: Add support for the new `dualroot` chain of trust.
   - plat/arm/fvp: Add support for fconf in BL31 and SP_MIN. Populate power
     domain desciptor dynamically by leveraging fconf APIs.

- PSCI
   - Example: "Adding new optional PSCI hook ``pwr_domain_on_finish_late``"

- Security
   - Example: "UBSAN support and handlers"
   - Add support for optional firmware encryption feature (experimental).

Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Build System
   - dtb: DTB creation not supported when building on a Windows host.

     This step in the build process is skipped when running on a Windows host. A
     known issue from the 1.6 release.

- Platforms
   - arm/juno: System suspend from Linux does not function as documented in the
     user guide

     Following the instructions provided in the user guide document does not
     result in the platform entering system suspend state as expected. A message
     relating to the hdlcd driver failing to suspend will be emitted on the
     Linux terminal.

   - mediatek/mt6795: This platform does not build in this release
