Console
=======

The TF-A console framework is used to register consoles for different boot states
so that user's output can be displayed on physical consoles throughout the different
boot stages. The framework also supports debug mode for general debugging purposes.

The console framework supports a number of different UARTs, it is highly likely
that the driver of the UART that is needed is already implemented, if not, a driver
will need to be written for the new UART in TF-A. Current supported UARTs are:
16550, A3700, PL011, CDNS, RCAR, STM32, UARTDM, MESON, UARTDM, SPE, IMXUART, IPUART.

    .. note::
        The supported UART list is non-exhaustive. Check if the UART driver has
        already been written before writing a new one.

    Console scopes and flags

    Scope   : Flag
    BOOT    : CONSOLE_FLAG_BOOT
    RUNTIME : CONSOLE_FLAG_RUNTIME
    CRASH   : CONSOLE_FLAG_CRASH

The console framework supports multiple consoles but only one instance of a UART
can be registered at any given moment. EACH console can have multiple scopes but
output for print can only be sent to a single console state (BOOT, RUNTIME, CRASH)
at a time. Multiple consoles can have the same state, which means a print to that
state will print the chars on each of these consoles. For example, setting two
separate conosles with RUNTIME state, then sending a print signal to the RUNTIME
state will print the chars on each of those consoles.

Registering a console
---------------------
To register a console in TF-A check if the hardware (UART) that is going to be used
is already defined, if not we will need to define it, for example, the **PL011**
UART driver is defined in ``include/drivers/arm/pl011.h``.

A skeleton console driver (assembly) is provided in TF-A ``drivers/console/aarch64/
skeleton_console.S``, this skeleton sets the rules for writing a new console_driver.
Have a look at ``drivers/arm/pl011/aarch64/pl011_console.S`` for an actual
implementation using this skeleton.

Function : console_xxx_register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : console_t *, ...
    Return   : int

This ASM Function is used to initialize and register a console. The caller needs
to pass an empty **console_t** struct which *MUST* be allocated in persistent
memory (e.g. a global or static local variable, *NOT* on the stack).

This function takes a ``console_t struct`` placed in x0 and additional
arguments placed in x1 - x7. It returns x0 with either a 0 on failure or 1
on success.

See ``console_pl011_register`` ASM function for an implementation of this
function.

    .. note::
        The ``xxx`` in the function name is replaced with the console driver
        name, for example, ``console_xxx_register`` becomes
        ``console_pl011_register`` in the driver for pl011.

Function : console_xxx_putc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : int, console_t *
    Return   : int

This ASM function is used to print a character on the console. It takes two
arguments, a character as int stored in w0, and the console_struct base address
stored in x1. It returns w0 with either the character on successs or a negative
value on error.

See ``console_pl011_putc`` ASM function for an implementation.

    .. note::
        Avoid using this function for printing to the console, instead use the
        ``debug.h`` print macros, such as: VERBOSE(...), INFO(...), WARN(...),
        NOTICE(...) and ERROR(...).

Function : console_xxx_getc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : uintptr_t
    Return   : int

This ASM function is used to read a character from the print buffer that have not been
printed yet. It takes a pointer to the console_struct as an argument and returns a
character on success or a negative value below -2 on failure.

See ``console_pl011_getc`` ASM function for an implementation.

Function : console_xxx_flush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : uintptr_t
    Return   : void

This ASM function flushes all the characters, that are still in the print buffer but
haven't been printed yet to the console. It takes a pointer to the console_struct
but doesn't return any value.

See ``console_pl011_flush`` ASM function for an implementation.

Function : finish_console_register xxx putc=1 getc=ENABLE_CONSOLE_GETC flush=1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Callbacks
    xxx      : name of the console driver
    putc     : 0 for off, 1 to turn on putc function
    getc     : 0 for off, ENABLE_CONSOLE_GETC to turn on the getc function
    flush    : 0 for off, 1 to turn on flush function

This assembly macro function is called by the ``console_xxx_register`` to
encapsulate the common setup that has to be done at the end of a console
driver's register function. It will register all of the driver's callbacks
in the **console_t** struct and initialize the **flags** field (by default
consoles are enabled for the "boot" and "crash" states, this can be changed
after registration with the console_set_scope() function). This function ends
with a tail call that will include return to the caller.

This macro REQUIRES console_t pointer in x0 and a valid return address in x30.

See ``include/arch/aarch64/console_macros.S``.

Multi Console API
-----------------

TF-A uses the multi-console API to manage the registered console instances and the
characters print queue. This can be found in ``drivers/console/multi_console.c``.

The multi-console API stores all registered consoles in a struct list ``console_list``
and makes sure only one instance of a specific console is present in this list (to
avoid an endless loop when going over the consoles for operations on them). A console
can also be removed from the console_list if no longer needed.

Consoles are registered with BOOT and CRASH scopes by default. These scopes can be
changed after registration using ``console_set_scope()`` function, as per the platform
requirement.

This API also helps print characters to the specified consoles, characters can also
be retrieved from the print buffer (this implementation may be a security concern and
thus needs to be implemented only if needed). It can also help flush the print buffer
to get rid of any lingering characters from the queue when changing from secure world
to the non-secure world.

The following functions are defined in the multi_console API.

Function : console_register()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : console_t*
    Return   : int

This function adds a console to the ``console_list`` declared in
``include/drivers/console.h`` and makes sure that there is only one instance
of a specific console in this list. This function is called by the
``finish_console_register`` asm macro function, at the end of the console
registration process.

This funciton always return 1. If the console is already present in the
``console_list`` it will return immediately with a value of 1, otherwise
it will add the console to the ``console_list`` and then return 1.

    .. note::
        The ``console_list`` is a list of type console_t, it is an ""extern""
        variable declared in ``include/drivers/console.h``.

Function : console_unregister()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : console_t*
    Return   : console_t* or NULL

This function removes a console from the ``console_list``. It will return the
removed console on success or a ``NULL`` character upon failure.

Function : console_set_scope()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : console_t*, int
    Return   : void

This function is used to set the scope of the registered console. A console
can be registered with upto three states (called the scope). These states are
BOOT - set using the flag ``CONSOLE_FLAG_BOOT``, RUNTIME - set using the flag
``CONSOLE_FLAG_RUNTIME`` and CRASH - set using the flag ``CONSOLE_FLAG_CRASH``.

It takes a pointer to the console and an int value (which is provided as the
FLAG value) as its arguments. This function does not return anything.

Function : console_switch_state()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : int
    Return   : void

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This function determines the console state (scope) for printing, i.e, TF-A will
start sending all logs (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, NOTICE, VERBOSE) to the consoles
that are registered with this new state (scope). For example, calling
``console_switch_state(CONSOLE_FLAG_RUNTIME)``, TF-A will start sending all log
messages to all consoles marked with the RUNTIME flag.

console state.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

This function takes a console state as the function only argument. This function
does not return a value.

Function : console_putc()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : int
    Return   : int

This function sends a character to the ``console->putc`` (struct member)
function of the active console, which is then printed on the active console
by the specified console's driver. For example, in PL011 the ``console->putc``
call points to the ``console_pl011_putc()`` function.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

int value of the character back on success or a negative int value on error.

    .. note::
        Do not use this function in TF-A release builds, instead use the log
        prefixes, for example, ``INFO("Print information here.")`` to print
        messages on the active console.

Function : console_getc()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : void
    Return   : int

not been printed to the console yet. This function is disabled by default for
security reasons but it can be enabled using the ``ENABLE_CONSOLE_GETC`` macro
if there is a need for it.

This function doesn't take any argument but returns a character as an int.

Function : console_flush()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : void
    Return   : void

This function will try to flush all the characters pending in the print buffer
of the active console thus removing them from the print queue. By default any
character sent to the ``console_putc()`` function will be printed on the active
console but if for some reason any characters still pending can be flushed via
the ``console_flush()`` call.

This function has no arguements and do not return a value.

Function : putchar()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    Argument : int
    Return   : EOF

This function overrides the weak implementation of the putchar library. It is
used to send a character to the ``console_putc()`` function to be printed to
the active console.

This function will either return the character on success or an **EOF** character
otherwise.
