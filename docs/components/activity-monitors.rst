Activity Monitors
=================

FEAT_AMUv1 of the Armv8-A architecture introduced the Activity Monitors
extension. This extension describes the architecture for the Activity Monitor
Unit (AMU), an optional non-invasive component for monitoring core events
through a set of 64-bit counters.

When the ``ENABLE_AMU=1`` build option is provided, Trusted Firmware-A sets up
the AMU prior to its exit from EL3, and will save and restore AMU counters as
necessary upon suspend and resume.
