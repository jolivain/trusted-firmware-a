Chain of trust bindings
=======================

The device tree allows to describes the chain of trust with the help of
certificates and images nodes, which in turn contains number of sub-nodes
(i.e. certificate and image) mentioning properties for every certificate
and image respectively.
Also, this binding allows to describe OID of non-volatile counters, memory
mapped address and size of non-volatile counter register.

Convention used in this document
--------------------------------

This document follows the conventions described in the Device-tree
Specification

certificates, certificate and extension node bindings definition
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Certificates node
        Description: Container of certificate nodes.

        PROPERTIES

        - compatible:
                Usage: required

                Value type: <string>

                Definition: must be "arm, certificate-descriptors"

- Certificate node
        Description: Describes certificate properties which are used
                     during the authentication process.

        PROPERTIES

        - root-certificate
                Usage: Required for the certificate with no parent.
                       In other words, Certificates which are validated
                       using root of trust public key.

                Value type: <boolean>

        - image-id
                Usage: Required for every certificate with unique id.

                Value type: <u32>

        - parent
                Usage: It refers to their parent image, which typically contains
                       information to authenticate the certificate.
                       This property is required for all non-root certificates.

                       This property is not required for root-certificates
                       as it is validated using root of trust public key
                       provided by platform.

                Value type: <phandle>

        - signing-key
                Usage: This property is used to refer extension node present in
                       parent certificate and it is required property for all non-
                       root certificates which are authenticated using public-key
                       present in parent certificate.

                       This property is not required for root-certificates
                       as root-certificates are validated using root of trust
                       public key provided by platform.

                Value type: <phandle>

        SUBNODES

        - extensions node
                Description: This is sub-node of certificate node.
                             Describes OIDs present in the certificate which will
                             be used during authentication process to extract
                             hash/public key information from this certificate.
                             OIDs in extension node are represented using number of
                             sub-nodes which contains 'oid' as property

                PROPERTIES

                - antirollback-counter
                        Usage: This property is used by all certificates which are
                               protected against rollback attacks using a non-volatile
                               counter and it is an optional property.

                               This property is used to refer trusted or non-trusted
                               non-volatile counter node.

                        Value type: <phandle>


                - oid
                        Usage: This property provides the Object ID of an extension
                               provided in the certificate.

                        Value type: <string>

Example:

.. code:: c

   certificates {
         compatible = "arm, certificate-descriptors‚Äù

         trusted-key-cert: trusted-key-cert {
                  root-certificate;
                  image-id = <TRUSTED_KEY_CERT_ID>;
                  extensions {
                        antirollback-counter = <&trusted_nv_counter>;
                        trusted-world-pk: trusted-world-pk {
                              oid = TRUSTED_WORLD_PK_OID;
                        };
                        non-trusted-world-pk: non-trusted-world-pk {
                              oid = NON_TRUSTED_WORLD_PK_OID;
                        };
                };
        };

        scp_fw_key_cert: scp_fw_key_cert {
                image-id = <SCP_FW_KEY_CERT_ID>;
                parent = <&trusted-key-cert>;
                signing-key = <&trusted_world_pk>;
                extensions {
                        antirollback-counter = <&trusted_nv_counter>;
                        scp_fw_content_pk: scp_fw_content_pk {
                              oid = SCP_FW_CONTENT_CERT_PK_OID;
                        };
                };
        };

                Note: Currently, all images are validated using "hash"
                      method. In future, there may be multiple methods can
                      be used to validate the image.

Example:

.. code:: c

   images {
         compatible = "arm, imgage-descriptors";

         scp_bl2_image {
               image-id = <SCP_BL2_IMAGE_ID>;
               parent = <&scp_fw_content_cert>;
               hash = <&scp_fw_hash>;
         };

         .
         .
         .

         next-img {

            };
        };
   };

Future update to chain of trust binding
---------------------------------------

This binding document need to be revisited to generalise some terminologies
like Object IDs, extensions etc which are currently specific to X.509
certificates.
