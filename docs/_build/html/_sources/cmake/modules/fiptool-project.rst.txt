.. cmake-module:: ../../../tools/fiptool/CMakeLists.txt

.. todo::

   A generic section about fiptool is missing which could be referred
   from CMakeLists.txt. The legacy doc contains irrelevant build information.

   It would be nice if the help text could be separated from the C source and
   be moved to a "resource" file. This would allow inclusion in reST document.
   Alternatively https://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-autoprogram/ could be
   used. But this makes the document build depending on availability of fiptool.
