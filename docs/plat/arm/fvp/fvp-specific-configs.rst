Booting Firmware Update images
------------------------------

When Firmware Update (FWU) is enabled there are at least 2 new images
that have to be loaded, the Non-Secure FWU ROM (NS-BL1U), and the
FWU FIP.

The additional fip images must be loaded with:

::

    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path_to>/ns_bl1u.bin"@0x0beb8000	[ns_bl1u_base_address]
    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path_to>/fwu_fip.bin"@0x08400000	[ns_bl2u_base_address]

The address ns_bl1u_base_address is the value of NS_BL1U_BASE.
In the same way, the address ns_bl2u_base_address is the value of
NS_BL2U_BASE.

Booting an EL3 payload
----------------------

The EL3 payloads boot flow requires the CPU's mailbox to be cleared at reset for
the secondary CPUs holding pen to work properly. Unfortunately, its reset value
is undefined on the FVP platform and the FVP platform code doesn't clear it.
Therefore, one must modify the way the model is normally invoked in order to
clear the mailbox at start-up.

One way to do that is to create an 8-byte file containing all zero bytes using
the following command:

.. code:: shell

    dd if=/dev/zero of=mailbox.dat bs=1 count=8

and pre-load it into the FVP memory at the mailbox address (i.e. ``0x04000000``)
using the following model parameters:

::

    --data cluster0.cpu0=mailbox.dat@0x04000000   [Base FVPs]
    --data=mailbox.dat@0x04000000                 [Foundation FVP]

To provide the model with the EL3 payload image, the following methods may be
used:

#. If the EL3 payload is able to execute in place, it may be programmed into
   flash memory. On Base Cortex and AEM FVPs, the following model parameter
   loads it at the base address of the NOR FLASH1 (the NOR FLASH0 is already
   used for the FIP):

   ::

       -C bp.flashloader1.fname="<path-to>/<el3-payload>"

   On Foundation FVP, there is no flash loader component and the EL3 payload
   may be programmed anywhere in flash using method 3 below.

#. When using the ``SPIN_ON_BL1_EXIT=1`` loading method, the following DS-5
   command may be used to load the EL3 payload ELF image over JTAG:

   ::

       load <path-to>/el3-payload.elf

#. The EL3 payload may be pre-loaded in volatile memory using the following
   model parameters:

   ::

       --data cluster0.cpu0="<path-to>/el3-payload>"@address   [Base FVPs]
       --data="<path-to>/<el3-payload>"@address                [Foundation FVP]

   The address provided to the FVP must match the ``EL3_PAYLOAD_BASE`` address
   used when building TF-A.

Booting a preloaded kernel image (Base FVP)
-------------------------------------------

The following example uses a simplified boot flow by directly jumping from the
TF-A to the Linux kernel, which will use a ramdisk as filesystem. This can be
useful if both the kernel and the device tree blob (DTB) are already present in
memory (like in FVP).

For example, the firmware can be built like this:

.. code:: shell

    CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf-  \
    make PLAT=fvp DEBUG=1             \
    RESET_TO_BL31=1                   \
    ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33=1        \
    all fip

.. note::
    | The above command will make use of the below defaults
    |
    | PRELOADED_BL33_BASE = 0x80080000
    | (Kernel load address, this address supports kernels before v5.7 that
      require a 512K text offset. New kernels doesn't require this offset and
      can tolerate other addresses.)
    |
    | ARM_PRELOADED_DTB_BASE = 0x87F00000
    | (DTB is placed 126.5MiB after kernel to support larger kernels)
    |
    | PRELOADED_INITRD_BASE = 0x88000000
    | (initrd comes 1MiB after DTB, giving DTB enough space)
    |
    | PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE = 0x00
    | (Initrd isn't required thus the default size is 0, user can override
    | this value if an initrd is provided.)

The above defaults can be overridden per the use case, for example to provide
the correct initrd size the above make command can be amended as:


.. code:: shell

    make PLAT=fvp DEBUG=1             \
    RESET_TO_BL31=1                   \
    ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33=1        \
    PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE=0x153840    \
    all fip

Then the FVP binary can be run with the following command:

.. code:: shell

    <path-to>/FVP_Base_AEMv8A-AEMv8A                            \
    -C pctl.startup=0.0.0.0                                     \
    -C bp.secure_memory=1                                       \
    -C cluster0.NUM_CORES=4                                     \
    -C cluster1.NUM_CORES=4                                     \
    -C cache_state_modelled=1                                   \
    -C cluster0.cpu0.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster0.cpu1.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster0.cpu2.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster0.cpu3.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster1.cpu0.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster1.cpu1.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster1.cpu2.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    -C cluster1.cpu3.RVBAR=0x04001000                           \
    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path-to>/bl31.bin"@0x04001000        \
    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path-to>/<device-tree-blob>"@87F00000 \
    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path-to>/<kernel-binary>"@0x80080000 \
    --data cluster0.cpu0="<path-to>/<ramdisk.img>"@0x88000000

.. note::
    The defaults (or overridden) addresses to the dtb, kernel, and ramdisk,
    provided on the run command, must be the same as the ones provided to the
    make command. The run command doesn't need the initrd size.

Ramdisk with a U-Boot header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the initrd comes with a u-boot header then offset the initrd address by 64
bytes (0x40), in the make command only, no need to offset the address in the
run command. When an initrd is provided the initrd size must also be set.

For example, using the default initrd address with the u-boot offset:

.. code:: shell

    make PLAT=fvp DEBUG=1             \
    RESET_TO_BL31=1                   \
    ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33=1        \
    PRELOADED_INITRD_BASE=0x88000040  \
    PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE=0x153800
    all fip

.. note::
    When offsetting for u-boot header and providing the initrd size as well
    using ``PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE``, remove 64 bytes of the initrd total size.
    For example, an initrd of size 0x153840 would become 0x153800.

Bypass DTB Runtime Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default value for initrd size i.e. ``PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE = 0`` will prevent
the runtime update of the dtb with initrd properties. This can be useful when the
user doesn't require updating the dtb with initrd start and end properties.

Unknown Ramdisk Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user doesn't know their initrd size they can specify a higher than expected
initrd size using the make command line macro, for example, if the initrd is below
128MiB set ``PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE = 0x08000000``. This will work, although an error
``Initramfs unpacking failed`` is encountered in the logs but it can safely be
ignored because, multiple initrd's can be stacked one after another so after linux
unpacks the first initrd successfully it looks for another straight after, which it
won't find and hence the error. If the initrd provided size is higher than its
actual size, this should boot successfully.

To avoid triggering this error, provide the correct initrd size at the make
command-line using the macro ``PRELOADED_INITRD_SIZE`` (adjust for u-boot
header if present).

Obtaining the Flattened Device Trees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the FVP configuration and Linux configuration used, different
FDT files are required. FDT source files for the Foundation and Base FVPs can
be found in the TF-A source directory under ``fdts/``. The Foundation FVP has
a subset of the Base FVP components. For example, the Foundation FVP lacks
CLCD and MMC support, and has only one CPU cluster.

.. note::
   It is not recommended to use the FDTs built along the kernel because not
   all FDTs are available from there.

The dynamic configuration capability is enabled in the firmware for FVPs.
This means that the firmware can authenticate and load the FDT if present in
FIP. A default FDT is packaged into FIP during the build based on
the build configuration. This can be overridden by using the ``FVP_HW_CONFIG``
or ``FVP_HW_CONFIG_DTS`` build options (refer to
:ref:`build_options_arm_fvp_platform` for details on the options).
