      "message": "I\u0027ve tested this and it seems to work for me with a few things to note.\n1) I need to disable SCMI in U-Boot or else it fails to boot (CONFIG_SCMI_FIRMWARE\u003dn and CONFIG_SCMI_AGENT_SMCCC\u003dn). This is used for BSP U-Boot but U-Boot won\u0027t work with this version of A-TF if these are enabled.\n2) I get an error performing a DSI write in U-Boot. I suspect I need to have a clock set correctly before I can do this properly. Other boards where I don\u0027t need to issue DSI commands in U-Boot seem to work just fine.\n\nTL;DR this seems to work for me, however I\u0027ll need some additional SCMI stuff before I can replace the BSP A-TF in all my use cases.\n\nThank you.",
