      "message": "This inclusion breaks the H6 build for me. I have a patch to fix this properly (by moving the whole sunxi_cpu_power_off_self() to the SoCs\u0027 directories), but the patch would be nasty to have before this one (b/c of code duplication). So can we just protect this with \"#ifndef SUNXI_CPUIDLE_EN_REG\" for this one patch? This uglyness would be removed one patch later then.",
