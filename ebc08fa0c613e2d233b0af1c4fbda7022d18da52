      "message": "Hello.  I believe the previous build failed only because the commit message had capital letters at the beginning :-).  I\u0027ve fixed that, but because no source files were changed, it does not appear that it\u0027s automatically kicking off another build.  Is there something I need to do to make that happen?  Thank you!",
