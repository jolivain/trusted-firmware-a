      "message": "It looks to me there is an unneeded/unnecessary dependency between the ACS test suite and TF-A-tests and/or TF-A.\nWhy isn\u0027t ACS suite delivering the SPMC and SPs manifests?\nThe SPMC manifest can be specified on TF-A command line by ARM_SPMC_MANIFEST_DTS. The layout file can be provided by SP_LAYOUT_FILE so it seems there is some sort of flexibility already.",

      "message": "ARM_SPMC_MANIFEST_DTS is useful to remove tfa-acs dependancy for fvp_spmc_manifest.dts file. \n\nBut it doesn\u0027t help in resolving secure-partitions information dependancy in fvp_tb_fw_config.dts file.  (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/10931/1/plat/arm/board/fvp/fdts/fvp_tb_fw_config.dts#75). Due to this we get below runtime warning after successfully loading three SPs.:\n- WARNING: Failed to determine the size of the image id\u003d37 (0) \n\nThis warning is for Ivy partition as acs has only three SPs.\n\nThis can be resolved in two ways:\n 1. By enhancing secure-partitions function for ACS partitions\n 2. By enhancing sptool to derived secure-partitions information from secure partition dts file(ex, cactus.dts). With this, we may not require to populate partition information in fvp_tb_fw_config.dts file.\n\nLet me know if any other alternative is possible.",
