      "message": "I don\u0027t like the fact that we\u0027re introducing things that are specific to some Arm platforms in a chain of trust description which was so far quite generic. This patch would set precedence for adding all sorts of platform-specific assets in this file...\n\nUnfortunately, there does not exist any chain of trust description file specific to Arm platforms or FVP right now. We might need to introduce one (as a copy of this file, which we can freely evolve) prior to this patch being merged. Let me discuss this further with some internal folks.",

      "message": "This platform-specific information should not be included in a generic file. This file is currently consumed by several platforms, including imx, rpi, qemu, synquencer, sociaonext, hikey, broadcom, etc.  The file was placed in the generic layer for this reason, I believe.\n\nCoT structures specific to a platform should be placed in the platform folder. You can either copy this (along with these newly introduced CoT structures) in a new file and place it in the Arm platform folder (and compile this file instead of tbbr_cot_bl2.c for Arm platform ) or use this file as it is without introducing platform changes and additionally create a new file for newly introduced CoT structures inside Juno platform and then compile both files (tbbr_cot_bl2 + newly created file for Juno) for Arm Juno platform. Is that makes sense?",
