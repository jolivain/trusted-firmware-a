      "message": "I don\u0027t like the fact that we\u0027re introducing things that are specific to some Arm platforms in a chain of trust description which was so far quite generic. This patch would set precedence for adding all sorts of platform-specific assets in this file...\n\nUnfortunately, there does not exist any chain of trust description file specific to Arm platforms or FVP right now. We might need to introduce one (as a copy of this file, which we can freely evolve) prior to this patch being merged. Let me discuss this further with some internal folks.",
