I\u0027m very confused how you found that though, can you navigate to that from the links the code review bot posted here? I tried to look through the failures, I didn\u0027t find anything about this...\n\n\u003e subject must not be sentence-case, start-case, pascal-case, upper-case [subject-case]\n\nI\u0027m... somewhat confused what the problem here is. Is it saying that the first letter after \"fix(plat/qti/sc7180):\" should not be capitalized? But \"QC\" is an initialism that is always capitalized regardless of where it comes in the sentence structure. This seems like a way too overzealous linter rather than an actual violation of the policy to me?",
