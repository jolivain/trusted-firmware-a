      "message": "I don\u0027t believe this is the right way to fix the issue. As you can see at line 21, there\u0027s a forward declaration of the entry_point_info struct. This was added to avoid pulling a potentially deep nested chain of other header files. Other prototypes in this file (cm_init_my_context() and cm_init_context_by_index()) use a struct entry_point_info rather than an entry_point_info_t. It looks like cm_setup_context() was missed.\n\nSo I suggest removing the inclusion of ep_info.h in this file and changing the prototype cm_setup_context() to use struct entry_point_info rather than the typedef\u0027ed version of it.",
