      "message": "Just for the records: the build-id generation should be disabled by default in GCC, but it might sneak in via CFLAGS or default options. Since we eventually run binary files, the build-id is probably discarded anyway, or it is put in a non-helpful position, like here at the beginning of the file. But since we don\u0027t have a symbol pointing to the build-id, and we don\u0027t use it from the code anyway, it\u0027s fine to force it off in the Makefile.",
