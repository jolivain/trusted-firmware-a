      "message": "There are are one or two edge-case platforms that need the CPU support library to be configured differently depending on the bootloader image that it\u0027s being linked in to, but right now we can only build a library once for all bootloader images. GENFW-8304 and GENFW-8209 are meant to clear the way on that, where GENFW-8304 is implemented by the `toolchain-detection` patch stack currently in review.",

      "message": "Hi Craig, we\u0027re trying to decouple as much as we can from architectural versions and migrate over to the feature detection framework, as the arch version tells us increasingly little about the feature set of the system. In theory, outside of organisation and for passing flags to other tools, there is not much use for the architecture version within TF-A itself, and conditional compile-time flags should be conditional on more concrete information.",
