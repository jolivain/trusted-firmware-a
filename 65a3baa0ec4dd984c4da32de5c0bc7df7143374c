      "message": "As I understand it, apart from multi-socket systems, having all GICR frames next to each other is the norm. But anyway, since this function just takes one GICR frame address, callers must iterate over multiple regions, if needed. I can amend the comment, if needed. \nAlso: the FPGAs all have Arm Ltd. GICs, which have exactly one contiguous GICR region (as described in the TRMs).",
