      "message": "I\u0027ve just realized that TPM_HASH_ALG was the way to configure the hash algorithm used by the event log driver until now. By changing the name, we might break some partners\u0027 build scripts which relied on it. The worst thing is, it might be a silent breakage, as the variable simply no longer has any effect on the code base.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some of the TF-A CI scripts still rely on it. Could you please push a patch to update them? The only CI patch I\u0027ve seen in review is https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/15083 and it does seem to take care of the renaming.\n\nI think it would be good to make changes in a backward compatible way. Something like that might be enough (I can\u0027t guarantee the syntax is correct!):\n\n ifdef TPM_HASH_ALG\n   $(warning \"TPM_HASH_ALG is deprecated. Please use MBOOT_EL_HASH_ALG instead.\")\n   MBOOT_EL_HASH_ALG\t\t:\u003d\t${TPM_HASH_ALG}\n else\n   MBOOT_EL_HASH_ALG\t\t:\u003d\tsha256\n endif\n\nBasically, the idea is that if the TPM_HASH_ALG variable is defined by the user, it should take precedence.",
