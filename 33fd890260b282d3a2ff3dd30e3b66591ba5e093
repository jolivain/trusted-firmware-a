      "message": "Hi Chris,\n\nThe changes look good to me. I have a few questions about what this update offers.\n\nIIUC, the Jenkins CI is currently showing warnings during the \u0027make distclean\u0027 process, and unconditionally attempting to install the tool via the Makefile eventually leads to the error \u0027make: convert-to-c: No such file or directory,\u0027 as the Jenkins environment cannot locate the tool. Jenkins is running Python version 3.10. Although these warnings are non-harmful, as file creation still occurs and it gets built for BL2, your changes seem to address these issues.\nAdditionally, your updates seem to improve the cot-dt2c tool with Python version 3.12 (on Ubuntu 24.04 and onward), which tackles the issues mentioned in the commit messages. Please correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\n\nAlso, IIUC, you used Poetry to manage third-party packages, which helps eliminate the need to pull in source files for third-party dependencies within the tool\u0027s source. The patch also preprocesses the device tree files before feeding them to the tool, which is a great enhancement. However, should it be mentioned that Python 3.12 can\u0027t parse #ifdef directives, whereas Python 3.10 didn\u0027t have this issue?\n\nThe patch also removes the Makefile for the toolâ€”does this mean we should no longer use the make command to build this tool? Additionally, should the test vectors (test DTSI files) be preprocessed, and some might not be required at all which were added for  #ifdef checks?\n\nWe need to update the documentation towards this tool as it used make commands and also it used direct dtsi files rather preprocessed ones so we need to update documentation towards input parameter also\nAlso, there are other tools in TF-A like tlc which also uses makefile, can we remove that too to make it consistent?",
