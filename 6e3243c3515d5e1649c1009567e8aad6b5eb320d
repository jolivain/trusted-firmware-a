      "message": "Hello Salom√©, \n\nI\u0027ve seen that a lot of files have changed since my last review. I wonder if there is a better way to consolidate all this. Maybe it is worth defining the OPENSSL_BIN_PATH variable in the main Makefile only, and then make the specific *.mk files inherit it or receive it as a parameter. I would like to open the discussion around this to see what would be the best approach regarding this.",
