      "message": "I would add SEPARATE_CODE_AND_RODATA build option to this list.\n\nI suppose TBBR options are overkill, what do you think?\n\nI am wondering whether we should also isolate debug-only build options (in a separate patch to this one). I mean, options that should never be enabled on a production system, things like DYN_DISABLE_AUTH, DEBUG (obviously!), SPIN_ON_BL1_EXIT, FAULT_INJECTION_SUPPORT, the options enabling traces (ENABLE_BACKTRACE, V, ENABLE_ASSERTIONS) - although these might be arguable.\n\nRegarding the location of this documentation file, I agree with John and it would sound more appropriate to me to have this under the same location as the user guide. I also agree with you that it\u0027s not \"getting started\" material, this is for more advanced users. So perhaps the root of contention here is because the build options should not be in the user guide in the first place. Should we move them into a new file, perhaps some building.rst at the top of the docs/ directory?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think SEPARATE_CODE_AND_RODATA has its place in this page. It is more a design choice than a check to do on new changes. The same goes for TBBR.\n\nYou mentioned FAULT_INJECTION_SUPPORT and I think it should be listed here.\n\nPaul will probably look at this patch next week to give his thoughts on the layout of the documentation and whether we should have a list of debug options.",

      "message": "About the location of this document - that\u0027s a tricky one. The User Guide is going to be split up - I have a patch that pulls the information from that file out into separate documents. In that patch I create a \"Build Options\" document, where this information could arguably go. On the other hand, I think there is value in having a list of options that are specifically called out for security.\n\nFrom the title and the first description I get the feeling that this page is intended to hold other kinds of security checks in the future, not just build options. What sort of things are we thinking of? Either way, I\u0027m not too worried about moving this file for now.",
