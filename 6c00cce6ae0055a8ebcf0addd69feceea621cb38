But I don\u0027t see anything using that prefixed DEFINES pattern.\nAlso CPPFLAGS is constructed using $DEFINES, so that wouldn\u0027t add anything, unless I miss something. The filter expression doesn\u0027t seem to work at all for me anyway.\n\nIn general I am a bit wary of requiring to specify the bootloader stage explicitly on the command line. The relevant -D options seem to be invariant for the BL stages, at least from what I saw. So do we really need that?",
