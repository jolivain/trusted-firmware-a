      "message": "And I am challenging this concept. The argument is that the in-place writing of SCTLR_EL2 is in fact a context restore, just obscured under a different name with funny constraints. In these configurations where it doesn\u0027t need to be contexted in and out (i.e. no SEL2), then the smc handlers do not call cm_el2_sysregs_context_{save, restore}. So this operation does, in fact become valid, as cm_prepare_el3_exit() is an initialization routine.\n\nAs for the memory footprint, this adds 16 bytes of context but removes a bunch of code (in unison with some of the previous patches) in cm_prepare_el3_exit(). I did a quick check before and after this patch and the binary came out pretty much identical for a minimal fvp config. I don\u0027t see this as a problem. The context structures need more work anyway.",
