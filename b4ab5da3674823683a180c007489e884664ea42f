To get the \u0027FIP\u0027 partition details inside GPT image -\u003e this code is specific to Arm \n   platform as loading.\n\nAs of now, I think we should go ahead with ARM_GPT_SUPPORT macro, I am thinking to get partition details using UUID to make code more generic, but that can be done in future patches.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e I presume platform should use PSA_FWU_SUPPORT flag for their own implementation to load FWU metadata.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e May be I need to add more documentation for this flag to make it clear? this flag in later on patches is used in common driver to get \n\u003e \u003e trial run state.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e I think this discussion is leading to have platform hooks, so that every platform can have their own implementation to load FWU metadata. Guard all such platform calls under PSA_FWU_SUPPORT build flag.\n\u003e \n\u003e Yes, I agree. I guess PSA_FWU_SUPPORT generic code would call some kind of plat_fwu_load_metadata() platform hook, which platforms have to implement. \n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e or do you think we should have common \u0027fwu_load\u0027 function which can be used by all platforms irrespective whether they support GPT or not? This can be tricky, FWU metadata is not part of FIP, platform can use their own method to save and grab this metadata information (though GPT is recommended in specification but it is not mandatory).\n\u003e \n\u003e If you think this would be hard to pull off, let\u0027s go for the first approach. Especially if we don\u0027t have any use case for FWU without GPT support right now!\n\nI think we can remove GPT specific code from FWU module so that it can used across (with GPT or non-GPT support). Gathering details of FWU metadata partition from GPT image can be done in platform specific way. \nLet me think more about it to come to some conclusion.",
