      "message": "Hi Chris\nI believe we should support fconf in BL1/BL2 by default when a platform wants to use fconf later in BL31. The primary responsibility of fconf starts early in boot phase. For example, it parses the fw_config.dtb to know which config files to load to memory and also populate information about them such that any other driver/software component can query for dynamic information using fconf APIs.\n\nTechnically speaking,(relevant parts of ) fconf can be independently supported in BL31 but that would defeat the purpose of fconf to provide a scalable unified access to dynamic info about the platform.\n\nI am unable to see a benefit in this patch. Please let me know if I am missing something. I would be happy to discuss over a call.",

      "message": "Sorry, I only just saw this (the comment was marked as resolved so wasn\u0027t showing up in the dashboard). This patch is less about making FCONF available only in BL31, and more about making the `*.mk` files side-effect free. That is, including `fconf.mk` should not automatically impact how your image is built, but behave more like C headers (which is the case with `amu.mk` introduced later on). I\u0027m not beholden to this patch, so if you\u0027d prefer we did not take this approach then I can take it out.",
