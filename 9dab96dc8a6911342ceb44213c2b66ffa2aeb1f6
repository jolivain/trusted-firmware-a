      "message": "EL3 firmware currently uses an O(n²) loop to check for duplicate partition IDs, and a loop that is at least O(number of regions being shared * number of regions already shared) to check for sharing a memory region that is currently in the middle of a transaction.  Also, freeing an object is O(size of reserved memory), and there is no check that e.g. memory being shared with Secure world is page-aligned and has not been already given to Realm or Root worlds.  There is no check I can see that address ranges within a transaction do not overlap.\n\nMaking individual transactions easier to validate is easy: just require address ranges and partition IDs to be sorted, and drop support for v1.0 transactions outright.  Fixing the remaining problems would require substantially more complex data structures in EL3, which means significantly increased attack surface.  Furthermore, unless the RMMD is aware of memory sharing, there will be unavoidable TOCTOU races.  Instead, I recommend piggybacking on the existing GPT code: if a piece of memory is not in Normal state, trying to change it to Secure or Realm state will fail.  This may require using bits in the GPT that are reserved for firmware use (assuming such bits exist) to indicate states like “this page is reserved by Secure world, do not transition it to Realm or Root world”.  Memory sharing messages could then be entirely opaque to Root world, minimizing its attack surface.  Secure world would be responsible for gracefully handling mapping errors.",

What about changing the spec in v1.2?\n\nHmm.. This is something we could look into, I\u0027ll discuss this option internally.\n\n\u003e What is the intended use of EL3 SPMC?  It seems to add a bunch of code in EL3 that could just as easily be in S-EL2, and therefore *should* be in S-EL2.\n\nThat is correct, the EL3 SPMC was originally designed to serve as a migration path, for example to allow systems to adopt FF-A on platforms that do not yet have S-EL2 support (e.g. pre v8.4). The long term expectation is that a S-EL2 SPMC (Hafnium) would be used when support is available.\n\n\u003e There are also some bounds checks that do not actually work.\n\nAh, would you be able to provide some links in the code to the relevant bounds checks and I\u0027ll take a look at updating them as well?",
