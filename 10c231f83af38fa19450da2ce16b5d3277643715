As for bl2, it can probably be used for learning purpose ? Or maybe the dynamic-configuration features can be used to provide information on the bl33 entry-point and device tree address ?\n\nIf not, you can probably remove the FIP definition.",

      "message": "Indeed there is no reason that the RPi4 couldn\u0027t use the same booting and image model as the RPi3, it\u0027s just more complicated and I can\u0027t test this without further components like U-Boot or any secure payloads. \"Just\" booting some BL33 (preloaded by the GPU) works fine with the new model, so I decided to go ahead on this one. If later someone needs the old model, we can always add support for this.\nBut looking at these definitions again, I just see that they are used in common code, but only when building BL1 and BL2. So I can safely remove this whole section.",
