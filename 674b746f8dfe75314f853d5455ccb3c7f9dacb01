      "message": "I\u0027m honestly not sure what sort of context you\u0027re looking for. ECV is an architecture extension, and part of 8.6. This patch pokes the control register to enable this extension when booting to EL2. That\u0027s all there is to it: check if 8.6 ECV Self Sync is available, and turn it on when TF-A is booting to EL2. This extension allows the hypervisor to setup \"self-synchronizing\" views of the timers for it\u0027s EL1 Guests. \n\nWhat sort of context are you hoping to see in the commit message?",
