      "message": "I don\u0027t think you\u0027re allowed to do this without having Arm publish an official revision of the SMC calling convention document to include these FIDs, unfortunately. We\u0027ve ran into the difficulties of adding platform-independent SMCs in the past (e.g. see this thread: https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/archives/search?mlist\u003dtf-a%40lists.trustedfirmware.org\u0026q\u003d%22SMC+to+intentionally+trigger+a+panic+in+TF-A%22)... the sad truth is that the Arm SMCCC was just not really designed to support that and there didn\u0027t seem to be much interest into opening up a new FID range to make this easier for us last time I asked. \n\n...maybe it\u0027s time to ask again? Actually, now that I think of it, let\u0027s just ask again. I\u0027ll send an email out to the mailing list to see if we can get more support for making this easier this time.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t pan out, I think your best option is to use the TOS FID range and make this an OP-TEE-specific FID (even though there\u0027s no reason why other TOSes may not want to support CBMEM console as well, and if they ever do so then we\u0027d end up with annoying FID fragmentation).",
