      "message": "Thanks, updated the patch, also making EL3_EXCEPTION_HANDLING depend on SDEI_SUPPORT by default now.\n\nTo answer your question of usage/testing on LKML: I\u0027m not yet done with full integration yet, partly due to the reservation issue (https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/pipermail/tf-a/2021-April/001093.html), but earlier adopters were already able to use this for running Jailhouse in GICC pass-through mode (https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/jailhouse-dev/CADiTV-03GyURVJ2De-Fe5reAcvveWQq7JxAUTh2kES2DSbwcWA%40mail.gmail.com). There, we use Event 0 as IPI in EL2 while leaving non-secure interrupts completely to the guest, which enables vmexit-free GICC access. Not invented here, used before at least in the Bao hypervisor,but there via an ugly downstream TF-A patch.\n\nOnce integration is done, you will find ready-to-use Ultra96 images in https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse-images.",
