      "message": "Is it possible to access firmware logs from the failed boots?  If so, I could add ERROR statements for debugging.  Alternatively, I can reorder patches so that the ones that are least likely (in my opinion) to break things are first.  I suspect the culprit is https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/18140, so I put that one last.",
