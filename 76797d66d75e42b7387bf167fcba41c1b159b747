The converse , viz, TF-A has DISABLED a feature but the feature is present in hardware, is not fatal to TF-A but could be a blocker for lower EL software (for linux it is a blocker, but there can be other NS software for which this may not be a blocker). hence this is a guidance to platform integrators/users and we should allow forward progress IMO.",
