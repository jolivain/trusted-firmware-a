      "message": "I was wondering why each SoC of xilinx( versal and zynqmp) have their own header files for PM. I guess they can use the same common header file which has function declarations but each SoC can have its own implementation of corresponding functions. \nFor ex: pm_client.h can be made common. Each platform can have its own pm_client.c file. \n\nI understand each Soc has different constraints. However, other platforms seem to follow this approach. For example, tegra platforms have common power controller file(mce.h)",
