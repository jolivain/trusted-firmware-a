      "message": "You mentioned in the commit message that length would not be valid here anymore, which I can\u0027t see. Only the fdt_get_name() call sets length. So what am I missing?\nIt seems like that node names are always null-terminated, so using strcmp is probably reasonable, though I am not sure ignoring length is a wise choice (it is returned for a reason, I guess).",
