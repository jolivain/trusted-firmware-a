      "message": "Why does this function need this argument? Given that we are in a GCM specific function, don\u0027t we already know that? Or is enc_alg referring to the block cipher only, which might be (?) something else than AES? If that\u0027s the reason, I\u0027d rather not add such flexibility until we need it. This is a static function so its prototype can easily be changed without much consequences if we ever get there some day.",
