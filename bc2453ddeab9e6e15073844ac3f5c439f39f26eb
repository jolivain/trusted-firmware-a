      "message": "@Manish Thanks for the review!\n\n\u003e Put \u0027{}\u0027 around while.\n\nWhich style do you suggest exactly? e.g.\n\n1.\n\n while (mmio_read_32(clk_cbcr) \u0026 CLK_OFF) {\n }\n\nor\n\n2.\n\n while (mmio_read_32(clk_cbcr) \u0026 CLK_OFF) {\n \tcontinue;\n }\n\nLooking through existing uses throughout the TF-A code base the one I used originally here actually seems to be the most common one:\n\n3.\n\n while (mmio_read_32(clk_cbcr) \u0026 CLK_OFF)\n \t;\n\ne.g. in drivers/arm/cci/cci.c or drivers/arm/gic/v3/arm_gicv3_common.c.\n\nThere is also an existing usage with this style in msm8916_setup.c so I would need to submit an extra \"style(msm8916)\" change to make that consistent there.\n\n\u003e Any possibility to put this under timeout?\n\nUnfortunately no. If we just continue after a timeout the register accesses that come after it would still inevitably hang or crash the system. I think this should never hang though unless there is some critical hardware failure.",
