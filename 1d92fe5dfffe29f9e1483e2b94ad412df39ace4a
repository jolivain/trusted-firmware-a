If this was a non-awful code review system, the cover letter/MR description should do the same.)\n\nGood point. Tl;dr: in our specific use case, it\u0027s to test the KASLR implementation in Trusty (and the kernel RNG in general) which use the TRNG SMC.\n\n\u003e If the purpose of this is simply to verify the plumbing, I highly prefer a https://xkcd.com/221/ type solution.\n\nThat wouldn\u0027t really test the RNG users properly. Even a LFSR would be preferable for that purpose.\n\n\u003e Finally: if the purpose is only for debug/testing, the code still needs a BIG warning comment block explaining just how badly incorrect this is architecturally and security-wise and why it\u0027s done anyway.\n\u003e You may want to consider this feedback for the Android repo as well.\n\nRight, this would only be used in CI for testing in Android. That said, I see how someone might run qemu + TF-A in production and an insecure RNG would be a massive problem for them. It sounds like a better approach would be to add a CSPRNG here, but would we have a secure way to seed it on qemu?",
