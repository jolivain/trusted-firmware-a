      "message": "Hi Juan Pablo,\nThis change will break a feature on STM32MP15, for which we can build a BL2 agnostic from the BL32 it will load (either SP_min or OP-TEE). The selection is made dynamically at runtime, depending on what is found in FIP.\nWhat was exactly the error you had, and on which platform?\n\n",
