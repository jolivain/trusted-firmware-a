It looks to be in the direction of removal of weak attribute for this function: bl2_plat_handle_post_image_load.\n\nAs a next step, could you please check which platforms use this function as a weak? This information may assist in the removal of the weak attribute for this function [1].\n\n[1]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/plat/common/plat_bl_common.c#n26",

      "message": "It would be preferable to have a single, unified function. I\u0027ve noticed that various CSS platforms, including Juno, Morello, TC, SGI, and N1SDP are all using `bl2_plat_handle_post_image_load` from the `arm_bl2_setup.c` file before this patch. Therefore, it is good to create a single `bl2_plat_handle_post_image_load` function for all these platforms by defining it in this file.\n\nWith the current patch, Juno, SGI using weak definition of `bl2_plat_handle_post_image_load` as per dump file, \n` 000000000402aa40  w    F .text  0000000000000008 bl2_plat_handle_post_image_load` that doesn\u0027t looks correct, it should use the strong definition instead, right?",
