      "message": "Checking a little bit our code, I think, we should rename the flag used.\n\nWhatever MP15 or MP13, we must manage, when trusted bard boot is enabled the ECDSA algo.\n\nI would prefer something like:\n\nSTM32MP_USE_NIST_P256\t?\u003d\t0\nSTM32MP_BRAINPOOL_P256T1 ?\u003d\t0\n\nIt is true for CRYPTO_LIB_USE_ROM too, we can also confirm that NIST_P256 and BRAINPOOL_P256_T1 are the only one supported.\n\nSo we will have a generic switch for both platform:\n\nifeq (${TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT},1)\nSTM32MP_USE_NIST_P256\t:\u003d\t1\nSTM32MP_USE_BRAINPOOL_P256T1:\u003d\t1\nendif\n\nThis implies a change in the PKA include file to match with these new flags.\nBased on that, the error could be managed at platform.mk level to confirm the supported algo rather than the PKA driver itself.",
