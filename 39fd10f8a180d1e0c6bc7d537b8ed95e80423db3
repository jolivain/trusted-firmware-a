Can you advise where exactly in the normal world does execution resume? \nIs it at the irq exception vector of the NS-Endpoint (running in NS-EL1) or the instruction whose address is held in ELR_EL1?",

      "message": "When EL3 does the exception return, ELR_EL3 contains the address of the instruction located just after the SMC which permitted to enter the SWd. This can typically be a direct message request in the normal world driver. Eventually as the SWd exit is because of a non-secure interrupt which is still pending, it likely traps immediately to the NWd kernel irq vector which then handles the interrupt. The execution is then resumed from the irq handler to the driver after the SMC.",
