There is 1 commit that seems particularly important to me:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git/commit/?id\u003d7be250b4d059771c47be00ec8d4df7f47e4ac77c\n\nIt seems to be a bug fix in the fdt_open_into() API, which is used by a couple of platforms in TF-A (QEMU, Rockchip and rpi4). Thus I think we should pull it into this upgrade.",
