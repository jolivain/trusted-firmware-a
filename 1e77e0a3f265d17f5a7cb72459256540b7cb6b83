Newly added files: These should be covered by the tf-a-ci-scripts change I already uploaded (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/21168)\n2. Include order: As far as I can tell, the include order in my changes is correct. I believe this is a bug in the include order check related to assembly *_macros.S includes (rather than typical C *.h header files). I have submitted a possible fix for this at https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/21574\n\nIf you re-run the CI the include order warning should be gone (assuming the CI job also fetches the new tf-a-ci-scripts changes).",
