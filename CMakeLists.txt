# We're done with very early setup, so we can now create the project. This will
# do some of the automatic compiler detection, which we need for setting up
# further configuration options.
#
# Note that this creates the following version variables:
#
# - `TFA_VERSION`
# - `TFA_VERSION_MAJOR`
# - `TFA_VERSION_MINOR`
# - `TFA_VERSION_PATCH`
# - `TFA_VERSION_TWEAK`
#
# Also, these directory variables:
#
# - `TFA_SOURCE_DIR`
# - `TFA_BINARY_DIR`
#
# Don't swap `C` and `ASM`. Per the CMake documentation:
#
# > If enabling `ASM`, list it last so that CMake can check whether compilers
# > for other languages like `C` work for assembly too.
