      "message": "The thing is march32-directive is already part of the TF_CFLAGS for gcc builds but for clang builds , since we use :\u003d instead of \u003d (which is used for gcc) , $(march32-directive) is not lazy expanded. So your solution might result in march32-directive duplicates being created for gcc build but would result in proper options for clang build.",
