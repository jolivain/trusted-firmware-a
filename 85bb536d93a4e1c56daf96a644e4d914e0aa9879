      "message": "State that in the patch or commit messages? Or do you just want to know in general?\nIf the latter: every feature is converted over, including those get_ style functions. But each of those features deserves some scrutiny in the review, as we need to decide whether each caller is interested in the actual ID field or the \"support status\".\nSo I have separate patches for each feature lined up, but waiting for the first batch to go in, so that we agree on the basics. HCX ang FGT are the guinea pigs, coinciding with the critical features that make Linux crash.",
