      "message": "Seems most things are in place, I have 2 comments\n\n1. The do_panic() call from plat_ea_handler seems to have changed with this patch, although I cannot detect any problem, there is some change on caller side. Ideally the do_panic() has the logic to correctly detect EL and do the crash dump and there is no need to differentiate between HANDLE_EA_IN_EL3_FIRST_NS flag. Can we have a single crash dump logic without conditional compilation ? \n\n2. The SPMD had some changes related to this flag for RAS handling. Would like Olivier to give an ACK as well.",
