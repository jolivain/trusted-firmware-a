      "message": "Yeah, it is quite a lot of argument. A few things to consider:\n- This exposes all the supported arguments of the DPE DeriveContext command. However, some arguments are not used in the TF-A use case. Those could be removed indeed.\n- However, DPE at the current stage mandates that all arguments be present in the CBOR encoded command. Later optional params support will be added to DPE. Then we can shrink down the argument list to the bare minimum.\n- The API was designed to be aligned with other PSA APIs. In/out buffers are modelled with 3 arguments:`*data_buf, data_buf_size, *data_actual_size`.\n\nI suggest accepting the code as is to be aligned with the current DPE implementation and later reducing the parameter set when optional parameters are supported by DPE.",
