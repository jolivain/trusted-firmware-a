In this case it is not a problem, as for Armv7, march-directive is overwritten in make_helpers/armv7-a-cpus.mk, but could that be a problem for an Armv8?\n\nFor example, if there was an Armv8.9 (don\u0027t know if that can happen), we will try to compile it with armv9-a, whereas it could have been better to compile it with armv8.8-a?\n\nIf this is changed, line 25 should be updated as well.",
