      "message": "I think there is an (undocumented?) assumption in TF-A project that the systems must be homogeneous i.,e., every CPU must be symmetric in the features it supports. IMHO support for heterogeneous systems is not trivial in TF-A and the fix you are providing may not be sufficient. At this point in time, heterogeneous CPU configuration is not supported.",
