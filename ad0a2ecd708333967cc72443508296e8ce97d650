      "message": "Some functions that receive node_idx as parameter might not work properly now. For instance:\n\n* cpu_data_by_index() expects an uint32_t, which can be problematic as the size of an unsigned int is not guaranteed to be 32bits.\n* psci_lock_init() expects an unsigned char for node_idx. This function would need to be fixed accordingly.\n\nThere might be other functions as well, I didn\u0027t check all of them.",
