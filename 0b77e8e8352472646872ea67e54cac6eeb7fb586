I have tried to reinvigorate email post thread as I think we were in the middle of a release and it must have got buried. I appreciate it if you can help remind the reviewers and those on the email list your wish you want your patch accepted even if sometime things go quiet depending on others.\n\nRepost of your email list posting:https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/pipermail/tf-a/2021-March/000995.html",
