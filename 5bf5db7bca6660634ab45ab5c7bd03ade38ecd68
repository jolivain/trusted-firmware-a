      "message": "Shouldn\u0027t set_config_info() accept the new optional property?\n\nWhat I see is that the FCONF_GET_PROPERTY() call goes through all the dyn_cfg_dtb_info_t* objects to find the one matches config_id, which can cause some inefficiencies, especially because the same object is accessed a few lines above (133). I would suggest adding the new optional property to set_config_info(). In case it is not possible/reasonable, maybe making set_config_info() return the accessed dyn_cfg_dtb_info_t* object and then set ns_config_addr is an alternative solution.",
