      "message": "Actually the Linux kernel repository is the canonical devicetree source, so changes should go through there. Indeed there have been complaints before that stdout-path is missing, it\u0027s just that no one could be bothered yet to actually submit a patch.\n\nSince the FVP DTs unfortunately have diverged quite a lot, I guess we can go with the change here, separately.",

In case of the FVP the baudrate doesn\u0027t really matter, but it\u0027s still good to be consistent.\nCompare to the other DTs in the directory, like for Morello, N1SDP, or the Arm FPGA.",
