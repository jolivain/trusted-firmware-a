      "message": "So up until here this is all the same between single and multi, right? So this should be unified in one file. Either this goes into n1sdp.dtsi or (preferably) we include the whole -single.dts here and just amend and complement it for multi-chip, accordingly.\nSame applies to the other common nodes below, for the common memory nodes (which me might omit except the first one, see the comment), and for the GIC nodes, which are almost identical.",

      "message": "Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nAs of now the CPU, MEMORY and GIC nodes are the nodes, which are having changes between multichip and singlechip configuration.\n\nI will prefer to have n1sdp.dtsi as common SOC file and single-chip.dts/multi-chip.dts as board variants.\n\nFor CPU, CPU0-3 nodes can be pushed to n1sdp.dtsi and rest CPU4-7 node details can be caputured in multi-chip.dts as following -\ncpus {\n                cpu4@100000000 {\n                        compatible \u003d \"arm,neoverse-n1\";\n                        reg \u003d \u003c0x1 0x0\u003e;\n                        device_type \u003d \"cpu\";\n                        enable-method \u003d \"psci\";\n                        /* node 1 */\n                        numa-node-id \u003d \u003c1\u003e;\n                };\n                cpu5@100000100 {\n                        compatible \u003d \"arm,neoverse-n1\";\n                        reg \u003d \u003c0x1 0x00000100\u003e;\n                        device_type \u003d \"cpu\";\n                        enable-method \u003d \"psci\";\n                        /* node 1 */\n                        numa-node-id \u003d \u003c1\u003e;\n                };\n                cpu6@100010000 {\n                        compatible \u003d \"arm,neoverse-n1\";\n                        reg \u003d \u003c0x1 0x00010000\u003e;\n                        device_type \u003d \"cpu\";\n                        enable-method \u003d \"psci\";\n                        /* node 1 */\n                        numa-node-id \u003d \u003c1\u003e;\n                };\n                cpu7@100010100 {\n                        compatible \u003d \"arm,neoverse-n1\";\n                        reg \u003d \u003c0x1 0x00010100\u003e;\n                        device_type \u003d \"cpu\";\n                        enable-method \u003d \"psci\";\n                        /* node 1 */\n                        numa-node-id \u003d \u003c1\u003e;\n                };\n\n};\n\nFor MEMORY node, I can place the Master Chip\u0027s Two memroy nodes under n1sdp.dtsi and Slave Chip\u0027s memory nodes under n1sdp-multi-chip.dts.\n\nFor GIC node, common details can be pushed to GIC node inside n1sdp.dtsi. In n1sdp-multi-chip.dts and n1sdp-single-chip.dts , the GIC node can only have \"reg\" properties details as following -\n\n\u0026gic {\n        #redistributor-regions \u003d \u003c2\u003e;\n        reg \u003d \u003c0x0 0x30000000 0 0x10000\u003e,       /* GICD */\n              \u003c0x0 0x300c0000 0 0x80000\u003e,       /* GICR */\n              \u003c0x400 0x300c0000 0 0x80000\u003e;     /* GICR */\n\n};\n\nKindly let me know your thought on above restructuring.",
