      "message": "Hi Hadi,\nIf my understanding is correct, the function plat_get_my_entrypoint should only be used to distinguish between cold and warm boot. It is used as part of el3_entrypoint upon reset. I believe it may not be appropriate to invoke warm_reset within this function. I believe existing PSCI hooks can be used to request warm reset. Let me know if you disagree.",

      "message": "Hi Madhukar,\n\nThanks for the review. Yes, you\u0027re correct. plat_get_my_entrypoint is designated for cold/warm boot selection. I am actually invoking warm_reset (socfpga_system_reset2) using PSCI hooks. However, our platform architecture requires 2 stages for invoking warm reset.\n\nHence, the 1st step is to invoke an L2 subsystem reset (through socfpga_system_reset2). This will reset the L2 cache, and cpus will reset to entrypoint. After that, the system needs to do a \u0027true\u0027 warm reset by configuring rmr_el3, which I decided to use plat_get_my_entrypoint as the hook.\n\nSo our warm reset is practically a cold reset with DDR intact. This is how they defined warm reset for the platform.",
