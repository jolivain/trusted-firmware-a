      "message": "nit: As of the current implementation, EL1 registers are set up unconditionally without considering this specific case i.e. SPMC running at S-EL2. Is this change indicative of the fact that EL1 registers are now managed by SPMC and that\u0027s why this setup of EL1 registers was avoided?  If yes, then it might be better to highlight the patch in which SPMC managed the EL1 registers at S-EL2 in the commit message.",
