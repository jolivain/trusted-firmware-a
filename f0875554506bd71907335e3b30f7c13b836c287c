      "message": "Please fix the static checks issues reported by the CI [1].\n\nThere are also some build failures. Can you please take a look at build failures for \u0027imx8mn-sdei\u0027 [2], \u0027imx8mm-default\u0027 [3], \u0027imx8mm-mb_hash256-tbb-embedtls-debug\u0027 [4], which all seem to be related to some missing function declaration?\n\nThe build failure for \u0027stm32mp1-usb\u0027 can be safely ignored. This should go away when the patch stack is rebased on the integration branch.\n\n[1] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-static-checks/2299/\n[2] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/1298724/console\n[3] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/1298783/console\n[4] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/1298816/console",
