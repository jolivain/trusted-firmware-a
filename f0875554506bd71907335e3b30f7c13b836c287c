      "message": "I\u0027ve been working on the static check and have it fixed locally, would be pushing the updated version shortly.\n\nI would have couple of points there, specifically:\n1. Outdated Copyright note warning cannot be fixed from my side, as it refers to NXP note which I cannot modify. It has been taken from the downstream fork, as the base of the development comes from there and according to BSD license I cannot change the Copyright note. So this I have to leave intact.\n2. Warning regarding the new file addition: I was trying to look for how to add this to the check, but it seems that the platform this file is included into is already present in the `tf-a-ci-scripts.git/tree/script/tf-coverity/tf-cov-make`. Hence I\u0027m not sure what shall be done in addition.\n\nFailures in the build were caused by missing `imx_hab_handler` which is defined in `plat/imx/imx8m/imx_hab.c` file. I guess since the CI does not pull the entire patch set, the Makefile changes were not included, hence the `imx_hab.c` was not compiled, causing the missing identifier error during linking.\n\nI believe that in order to solve it, I would either have to squash all the changes in one commit (entire HAB support), or have a CI to build the entire series at once.\n\nCan you please advise on what would be more preferred solution here?",

      "message": "Sorry, I should have been clearer, only static checks *errors* need fixing, warnings are optional.\n\n1. The outdated copyright note is a warning only. Moreover, the copyright line format looks compliant to me (let aside the old date) and Bai Ping also confirmed it looks alright. So we can ignore this one.\n\n2. I had a closer look and I agree with your assessment. I expect that this warning will go away with the next patch in the series that include plat/imx/imx8m/imx_hab.c file into the build. This is the same issue as the link errors you\u0027ve analysed. So that\u0027s fine, this can be ignored as well.\n\nIt is possible to make the CI pull the entire patch set and I agree this is preferrable in this case. For that, please kind I request you to:\n\na) Post your latest version of the present patch for review, including fixes for the coding style violations reported by the CI (which I assume is what you\u0027ve fixed locally?) Again, only errors really need fixing, for warnings it\u0027s up to you.\n\nb) Rebase the next patches in the series on top of a).\n\nThen I will trigger the CI loop again but on the top patch in the series this time. This will have the effect to test all patches in the series. So there is no need to squash the patch stack.",
