      "message": "Correct me if I am wrong but I think this part of the comment is meant to refer to the following ASN.1 grammar excerpt:\n\n Extensions  ::\u003d  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension\n                                 ^\n                                here\n\nHowever, the Extensions field itself is optional:\n\n        extensions      [3]  EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL\n                             -- If present, version MUST be v3\n\nwhich means that it is valid from a specification perspective for an X.509 v3 certificate to have no extensions at all. Do you agree? If yes then I think we should reword this part of the comment. I am fine with the code changes below but my understanding (as discussed in the other review [1]) is that they don\u0027t change the behaviour in any way - lines 316-320 already enforce that at least one extension is present, a do-while loop just makes that fact more explicit.\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17898/comment/e1443ede_485dacfb/",
