      "message": "StMM, which is a SEL0 SP uses SSL for secure boot. The SSL library use FPs to do the calculations. I suspect denying access to the FPregs in Secure World would cause issues.\n\nCould you please add more details on why there is a conflict between SVE and FP Rregs?\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, but according to my understanding, If SVE registers are saved, it will automatically save fpregs because both point to the same set of registers. It is like x and w core registers. Same registers, different widths.",
