      "message": "The node name suffix in the *DTB* needs to match the reg property, so you need to pass reg_prop here. The *label* in the *.dts* file carries the CPU index (as returned by plat_core_pos_by_mpidr()), but the label is a DTS source feature only, and does not exist in the flattened binary version.
