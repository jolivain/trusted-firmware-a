      "message": "I agree with you, _Bool is *at least* 1 byte long but that doesn\u0027t say what its *exact* width is. If I am not mistaken, it could well be 8 bytes long and that would still be compliant with the C standard. This code is making an assumption on the exact size of the _Bool type and I think it should not. And even so, assuming that _Bool is indeed 1 byte long, there would still be no guarantee that the structure is 4 bytes long, as the compiler is free to insert padding bytes between fields (unless the structure is declared as packed).\n\nIn fact, given that the n1sdp_plat_info structure is passed from SCP over SDS, I am guessing it is crucial that both firmwares have the same view of the structure layout. So I think we need to declare the structure as packed and use fixed-width types only (i.e. replacing \"bool multichip_mode\" by \"uint8_t multichip_mode\").\n\nDoes it make sense?",
