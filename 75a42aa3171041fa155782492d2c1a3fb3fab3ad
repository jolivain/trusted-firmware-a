      "message": "We need to update this comment, as it will now be aligned on 4 bytes on AArch32.\n\nThat got me thinking about AArch32 PIE firmware images. The TF-A doc [1] says that ENABLE_PIE is supported on a few images only: BL2_AT_EL3, BL31 and BL32 (TSP). Amongst these, BL31 and TSP are not used on AArch32. So the only PIE firmware image we can build for AArch32 would be BL2_AT_EL3.\n\nAs a quick experiment, I tried to build an AArch32 BL2_AT_EL3 with ENABLE_PIE with this patch and it seems to build and run fine. I am not 100% sure my test environment is correct, though, as unfortunately the CI appears to have no test coverage for PIE testing whatsoever so I do not have a reference test environment...\n\nWhat kind of testing did you do for this patch? I just want to make sure we are confident about the effect of this patch before we merge it.\n\n[1] https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/build-options.html",

(or did Arm test it before?)\n\nI\u0027ve talked further with some team members and learnt that PIE is enabled when RESET_TO_BL31\u003d1 on Arm platforms (see [1]). So I stand corrected, we do have some PIE testing in the CI today, although it would be good to extend this to other configurations and firmware images as well.\n\nMoreover, I am convinced that the engineer who added the original PIE support in TF-A tested it manually at the time it was developed but I don\u0027t know the details of that.\n\n[1] https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/plat/arm/common/arm_common.mk#n150 \n\n\u003e When I tried ENABLE_PIE, it did not work at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e So, I needed to commit 511046eaa28f89d0ae1d8577bc940ad02d129f19\n\u003e and some more to make it work.\n\nI\u0027ve just tried to revert commit 511046eaa28f89d0ae1d8577bc940ad02d129f19 and compiled BL31 with RESET_TO_BL31\u003d1 on Arm FVP platform, to see whether I would observe the same issue as you but I don\u0027t: no section is inserted before .text.\n\nI suspect we might not be using the same toolchain version, which could result in sections layouts differences I guess. I am using the GCC version indicated in the TF-A doc at [2], i.e.:\n\n $ aarch64-none-elf-gcc --version\n aarch64-none-elf-gcc (GNU Toolchain for the A-profile Architecture 9.2-2019.12 (arm-9.10)) 9.2.1 20191025\n\n[2] https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/prerequisites.html#toolchain",

      "message": "I think we might be talking about 2 different things here.\n\nAs you know, the existing linker scripts use the following pattern:\n\n    . \u003d ALIGN(8);\n    __RELA_START__ \u003d .;\n    .rela.dyn . : {\n    } \u003eRAM\n    __RELA_END__ \u003d .;\n\nI now realize they are defining the __RELA_START/END__ symbols *outside* of the section, which is what you pointed out in your answer. Understood, I am OK with this change. So with this change, this would become:\n\n    .rela.dyn : ALIGN(8) {\n        __RELA_START__ \u003d .;\n        __RELA_END__ \u003d .;\n    } \u003eRAM\n\nThis still specifies no input section to pull into section .rela.dyn. Instead I think you\u0027re proposing in this patch:\n\n    .rela.dyn : ALIGN(8) {\n        __RELA_START__ \u003d .;\n        *(.rela*)\n        __RELA_END__ \u003d .;\n    } \u003eRAM\n\nMy original question was around line 112 specifically. I am wondering why it was OK to specify no input section before, and now we\u0027re specifying *(.rela*) explicitly.",
