      "message": "We need to update this comment, as it will now be aligned on 4 bytes on AArch32.\n\nThat got me thinking about AArch32 PIE firmware images. The TF-A doc [1] says that ENABLE_PIE is supported on a few images only: BL2_AT_EL3, BL31 and BL32 (TSP). Amongst these, BL31 and TSP are not used on AArch32. So the only PIE firmware image we can build for AArch32 would be BL2_AT_EL3.\n\nAs a quick experiment, I tried to build an AArch32 BL2_AT_EL3 with ENABLE_PIE with this patch and it seems to build and run fine. I am not 100% sure my test environment is correct, though, as unfortunately the CI appears to have no test coverage for PIE testing whatsoever so I do not have a reference test environment...\n\nWhat kind of testing did you do for this patch? I just want to make sure we are confident about the effect of this patch before we merge it.\n\n[1] https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/build-options.html",
