      "message": "There is a lot of similarity between this file and fvp_spmc_manifest.dts. I believe this is intentional because spmc manifest has lot of nodes and properties to describe SPMC itself rather than the SecurePartitions(vm) that would be loaded by SPM. In this case, instead of cactus SP, we are loading OP-TEE. So my concern is can we create a common SPMC manifest dts include file?",
