Not sure what the right place is..this is whta i used to drive testing on the new code.. i\u0027m not as familiar with the test infra, so if you have better ideas i\u0027m happy to move it around and change..\nWas not sure how else i could \"trigger the functionality for EL3 SPMD direct messages other than a group0 interrupt (which i dont have on FVP).",

      "message": "Yes sure I understand. It seems like the build error I had before does no longer apply so ignore this.\n\nI\u0027m thinking perhaps we could add an FVP platform specific SiP. We know of this use case for routing a legacy normal world SMC (not in FF-A range) to a SP through an EL3 FF-A dispatcher like you did in current change. This would help legacy nwd drivers that have not yet migrated to FF-A. Or nwd SMCs requiring firmware handling in the secure world e.g. TRNG SMCs where the back end is implemented in a SP.",
