      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s what I want. Similar to how it only gets one shot when loading via the firmware during BL32. This is also essential for security, the SMC to load Op-Tee must be invoked while the platform can still trust itself...and once it starts allowing network connections and modifiable filesystem mounts, then that trust is gone.",
