      "message": "Using the same macros to initialize EL3 and EL2 sysrgisters are a recipe for disaster as there is not architectural guarantee that the bit fields are the same across ELs. Also as seen in the patch , some of the registers are only relevant for EL3 (like SCR_EL3 ) and the patch needs to do the equivalent to hcr_el2. \n\nMy view is this EL2 reg init is better to be done separately from EL3. There are aspects of C runtime that be made common for initialization between EL3 and EL2 but not the register initialization.",
