      "message": "We used to invoke a function to determine whether the firmware (FW) was in a trial or an accepted run state. \nHowever, with the updated specifications, three distinct states are now defined: invalid, valid, and accepted. Therefore, could we now explicitly verify if an image is accepted by checking bank_state[#bank_no] \u003d\u003d 0xFC before proceeding with actions such as incrementing the NV counter or implementing other use cases, such as setting platform-specific registers.",
