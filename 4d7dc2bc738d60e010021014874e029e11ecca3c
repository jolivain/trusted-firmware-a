We are currently working with the mt8195 while bringup of the mt8188 is in progress...so Mediatek probably hasn\u0027t upstreamed the required changes for 8188 yet for SPD support.",

      "message": "Joanna,\n\nI took a look at the CI+2 failures and there are some relating to optee...but they\u0027re not configs I\u0027ve changed so I think they may be general flakes.  Can you take a look and let me know what you think? Do you normally just rerun the failed jobs to then see if they\u0027re all clean, or just CI+2 the whole thing again?",
