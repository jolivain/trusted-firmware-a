      "message": "this is still an unsafe memcpy. The size parameter is useless, if you don\u0027t do any checks. I think you\u0027re missing the point here. Both source and destination must be the same size, or the destination buffer must be able to hold the data in the source without overflows. Use size to ensure one of the conditions is true, before doing the memcpy..",
