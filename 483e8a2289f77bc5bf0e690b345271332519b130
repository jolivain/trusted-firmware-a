      "message": "Respect the return value of this function. If it indicates a failure, we should print an error message indicating that GPT loading has failed, primary and secondary. It would be beneficial if the \u0027partition_init\u0027 function also considers the return value, allowing the caller to take appropriate action.\n\nBut I\u0027ve noticed in a subsequent patch that you\u0027ve created the \u0027gpt_partition_init\u0027 function, which is utilized by Arm platforms and calls \u0027panic\u0027 on failure. I believe it would be a good practice for all platforms to transition to using this \u0027gpt_partition_init\u0027 function instead of \u0027partition_init,\u0027 with the intention of eventually deprecating the latter.",
