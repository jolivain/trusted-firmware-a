This might be the simplest solution, although, we are trying to move away from the usage of weak symbols in TF-A. Yann, how would you suggest handling this?",

      "message": "Hi Harrison,\nI agree the simplest solution would be the weak function, especially as we do not intend to support this sensor protocol on STM32MP1. But as you said we try to get rid of weak function (or at least avoid new ones).\nThe cleaner solution would be to manage an ops structure in this file and have some registration function in platform code to replace the weak functions. But that\u0027s a bigger work.",
