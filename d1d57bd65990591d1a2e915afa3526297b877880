Kindly ensure these newly added source files are covered by : \n   a. Coverity scan analysis by adding them to \"tf-cov-make\" build script with the appropriate build configurations. \n   b. Built as part of one of the platform configurations present in \"tf-l1-build-plat\" test group.\n\n   Please refer to the tf-a documentation for more detailed explanation. \n   \"https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html#add-build-configurations\"\n\n2. Please ignore if your files are already updated. Further the Code Maintainer will \n   resolve the issue by taking appropriate action.\n\n\nI understand the CI failure but wonder how to solve it.\n\n\"tf-cov-make\" already covers qemu_sbsa target and this new file is now part of that build.",
