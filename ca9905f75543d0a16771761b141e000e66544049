      "message": "Hi John, it would be OK without the warning. The feature was silently disabled for aarch32, which is no more the case now. I had no warning when compiling aarch32 platforms. I remember a similar discussion where it was decided to have such features disabled by default, and platform should enable them. See: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/10807/comment/68ff259d_cd4b0ac3/\n\nMaybe my patch is incomplete here, and I can also change the warning and override with an error in the Makefile?\n\n\nBest regards,\nYann",
