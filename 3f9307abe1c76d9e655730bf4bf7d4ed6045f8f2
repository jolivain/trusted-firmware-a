Similar to what we did here [1]. @Sandrine and @David what do you think?\n\nI am not sure... The options forcefully enabled here [1] are related to hardware dependencies of ENABLE_RME architectural feature. MEASURED_BOOT and TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT are a different matter because they are software features. It is of the same nature of ENABLE_PIE, which we do *not* forcefully enable [2], see line 189. So I would lean towards keeping the patch as is, with an error message.\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/22605/2/Makefile#204",
