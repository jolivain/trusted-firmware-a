      "message": "So my rationale was as follows: for compatibility with the SRAM based ports and to allow non-secure access to the very beginning of DRAM, I start at offset 0x4000. The earliest used offset after this is the (former) Linux kernel text offset, at 512KB (0x80000). I left a gap of 64K before that, for instance to hold the DTB. This gives me the 0x70000 as an upper limit.\nI think it\u0027s easier to reserve more, now, even if we might not need that at the moment. If we start with a smaller amount of memory reservation, I see people hard coding this everywhere, which would make it hard to increase this later. So instead of inventing some limit, I used the reasoning above to give as much as possible, within reason.\nI don\u0027t have a very strong opinion on this, though, let me know what you think!",
