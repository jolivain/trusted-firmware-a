Now I\u0027ll have to add it at each line.\nWe could add VERBOSE messages, but that would increase binary size for platform keeping those traces. That\u0027s not the case for ST platforms, and I could still have easier debug with these lines after the includes:\n#undef VERBOSE\n#define VERBOSE ERROR",
