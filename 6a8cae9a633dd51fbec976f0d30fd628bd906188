      "message": "This patch is assuming that the kernel and the error handler share the console. Is this really required? Why not just add it to to the ERROR statement below? I realize we may lose the string \"ERROR\".\nMoreover, if the kernel and EL3 share the same console, adding a new line may not help at all. On a multi core system, the kernel could still be printing on another core while this code executes on another core and you would still end up with garbled information.",
