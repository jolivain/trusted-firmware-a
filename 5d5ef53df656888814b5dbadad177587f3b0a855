      "message": "Well, I intentionally put the timeout and the panic() there to make sure you would notice if it just never resets at all. We just need to set the timeout to the largest amount of time that we would normally expect it to take, so that we can be sure when the panic() is hit it actually means the reset didn\u0027t work as intended.",
