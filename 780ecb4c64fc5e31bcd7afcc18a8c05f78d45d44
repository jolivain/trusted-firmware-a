      "message": "What do you mean with \"fused off\", exactly? If you mean: \"fuses burned at the fab to down-core SoCs\", then this better would cover the GICR as well.\nWe use this very same algorithm above, and also Linux iterates through the GICR frames until it finds the LAST bit set. If there is none, it panics (the reason for this patch, actually).\nSo I would hope silicon vendors have considered this ;-)",
