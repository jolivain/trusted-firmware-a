      "message": "I think the logic of checking SPSR_EL3 at runtime is flawed. After boot, SPSR_EL3 will always have a value corresponding to lower EL. Which means even a fault from EL3 firmware will be treated as an error from lower EL and `elx_panic` will be invoked.\n\nSuggest to remove elx_panic and just have el3_panic to print all relevant info.",
