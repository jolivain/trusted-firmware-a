      "message": "Hi Yann, \nThis feature anyways gets checked during runtime[1] when this build flag is enabled, so I don\u0027t think default enablement of this flag in anyways hamper Armv7 based platforms. \nAlso, the platform can override this option via platform makefile if they want. \nWhether this works or, do you have a different opinion?\n \n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/10805/2/lib/extensions/sys_reg_trace/aarch32/sys_reg_trace.c#26",

      "message": "Hi Manish, I\u0027ve seen the check. But it still means a file is compiled and some code is executed at runtime. I agree it is not huge, but it is still some useless code for Armv7. Maybe we could override the values in the dedicated make_helpers/armv7-a-cpus.mk file?  I\u0027ve not checked if that could easily be done, but that would avoid modifying all the Armv7 plaform.mk files.\nSome more flags in make_helpers/defaults.mk may be concerned as well?\nAnyway all that could be in a separate patch, I\u0027ll remove my -1 here.",
