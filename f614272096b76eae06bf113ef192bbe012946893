Since we are okay with short term solutions, why can\u0027t your platform create a wrapper crypto mod (which is already customizable) and add this internally?\nThat way this change does not need to make it upstream.\nIs there a reason to not hook crypto_mod_verify_hash to do the same thing?\napologies if this was already discussed.
