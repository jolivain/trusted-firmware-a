      "message": "Sorry for the late response. Was out of office. I saw Sandrine\u0027s email about being careful about adding platform APIs. Since we are okay with short term solutions, why can\u0027t your platform create a wrapper crypto mod (which is already customizable) and add this internally?\nThat way this change does not need to make it upstream.\nIs there a reason to not hook crypto_mod_verify_hash to do the same thing?\napologies if this was already discussed.

      "message": "No issue Raghu, the problem is about to check the specific way to manage only the ROTPK hash and not the other keys.\n\nThere is nothing to differentiate the crypto API call between the root key and another key.\nThe crypto_mod_verify_hash must be at least just to verify the hash whereas the issue comes from the ROTPK which is not only the key but a key + addons.",
