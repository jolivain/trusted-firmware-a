That said, I\u0027ve run all our CI tests on FVP and Juno and could not see any agression (just like you did on QEMU)...\n\nStill, I think we should leave this patch out of the v2.3 release. The fact that we do not understand it to the bottom raises the risk of introducing a bug. What\u0027s your opinion on this?",
