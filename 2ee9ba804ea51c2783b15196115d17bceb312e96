Its not appropriate in this document to overthink all the edge cases as that will just confuse submitters.\n\nMaybe somewhere, not in this document some guidelines for maintainers should be listed but broadly they are make the process work using good judgement as no process is perfect. \n\nFrom a submitter perspective if they cannot get a code owner approval it will help maintainers if they seek code owner approvals. Maintainers then can make a judgement call on if what they are seeing is good enough for them to fill in the code owner approval so passing that check ready for submittal.",
