      "message": "That seems mostly alright. I compared the MMIO base addresses against some RPi-OS .dtsi file, and they match. Please move those register offsets as detailed below.\n\nWhat is the DT/PSCI story? Does their firmware stub now also provide PSCI services, and thus we don\u0027t need to patch the DTB anymore? Also the reserved memory is already covered? Just looked at their .dtsi, but was curious if you know more.",

Can you please move them into include/drivers/rpi3/mailbox/rpi3_mbox.h? (I admittedly should have done this 4 years ago already, but here we go ...)",
