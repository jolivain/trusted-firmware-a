      "message": "The purpose of the delay is to minimize inrush, so I would expect long-term negative effects to start even without an immediate failure. (... then again, it has been zero for a long time.)\n\nStill, likely only the last delay is needed, since things worked by swapping MMIO writes. My 10 microsecond suggestion was intended to get things working in as few tries as possible.",
