      "message": "While I understand the need for some solution today for this platform, I don\u0027t want this to set an example for all the vendors to define set of vendor specific SMCs for extracting such information. With most of the firmwares(TF-A in this context) supporting device trees these days, it becomes much easier to push all such the platform specific data into the device tree instead of defining such SMCs. I would like the TF-A community to push back such solution for any other real silicon platforms. Also once we have support for DT parsing in various firmware(like UEFI/U-Boot/whatever..), we must revert this change and move towards using that. With firmware handoff specification also being cooked up now, I think DT must be the way for such things that are already well defined in the DT.\n\nBTW what prevents from using DT based solution today for this platform ? I assume these SMCs are called from UEFI ? If UEFI could parse such info from DT passed as part of firmware handoff, will that work here ? Just trying to see if I am missing anything else that needs to be considered for a standard solution instead of vendor/platform specific SMCs.",
