That said,\n\u003e have it handled by SPMC + SPs.\nDo you agree this isn\u0027t necessarily the way forward for FF-A?\nAs we intend to provide an ABI to forward a G0 interrupt from S-EL2 to EL3, at least for the TF-A/Hafnium reference code base there is no case of SPMC handling a G0 interrupt, or even a SP. The latter cannot claim ownership of interrupts other than G1S by the spec. I would like to prevent cases that aren\u0027t actually queried by the spec.",
