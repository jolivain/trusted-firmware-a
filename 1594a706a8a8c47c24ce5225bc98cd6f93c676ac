It seems a bit misleading since it encompasses everything that the \u0027gicv3_set_pmr\u0027 function does, along with the errata workaround. Is there a reason why we can\u0027t simply use the \u0027gicv3_set_pmr\u0027 function itself, incorporating a compile-time condition to apply the errata workaround? Perhaps I\u0027m missing something here?",
