      "message": "Hi Benjamin,\n\nThat warning comes from the `checkpatch.pl` script, which originates from the Linux kernel project. TBH I did not know that it discouraged against using `strlcpy()`. This is not something which the TF-A project adopted as a coding guideline. On the contrary, TF-A coding guidelines [here](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-guidelines.html#libc-functions-that-are-banned-or-to-be-used-with-caution) encourages using `strlcpy()` in place of `strcpy()`/`strncpy()`. This is why TF-A libc does not provide an implementation of `strscpy()`.\n\nSo this looks like a conflict between Linux and TF-A coding styles to me. For now, I would consider that [TF-A coding guidelines](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-guidelines.html#libc-functions-that-are-banned-or-to-be-used-with-caution) take precedence and that the static checks warning you got can be ignored. I\u0027ll give you a waiver and override the Verified score for you.\n\nThat being said, this does raise a good point. I\u0027ve just read about `strlcpy()` and `strscpy()` and I agree that `strscpy()` looks more robust and less error-prone. I think we should consider changing TF-A coding guidelines in this regard.\n\nI\u0027ll bring up the topic to the wider TF-A community.",
