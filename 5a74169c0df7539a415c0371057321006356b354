      "message": "now that i think about this, perhaps we need to have the nv counters separated as platform nv counter and sip nv counter.. It is entirely possible that the SiP owns El3, S-EL2, but allows a platform owner to run secure partitions(which are isolated and lower privileged) be owned by a platform owner, that also signs the platform firmware ie non-trusted firmware like UEFI etc..What do you think of that split?",

      "message": "Yes, I agree. A split around SiP/Platform Owner NV counters makes more sense than a split around Trusted/non-Trusted NV counters in the context of the dualroot CoT.\n\nI would suggest we do that as a future refinement, though. I don\u0027t think it should delay this patch.\n\nIf we consider that in the future TRUSTED_FW_NVCOUNTER_EXT \u003d\u003d SIP_NVCOUNTER_EXT and NON_TRUSTED_FW_NVCOUNTER_EXT \u003d\u003d PLAT_NV_COUNTER then I guess we ought to protect:\n* the SIP_SECURE_PARTITION_CONTENT_CERT with the Trusted NV counter\n* the PLAT_SECURE_PARTITION_CONTENT_CERT with the non-Trusted NV counter\n\nas I suggested above. If instead we use the same counter then it implies that during a firmware upgrade both (or none) certificates will need to be upgraded, requiring coordination from the SiP and platform owner (which is not the model we want here).",
