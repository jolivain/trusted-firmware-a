      "message": "now that i think about this, perhaps we need to have the nv counters separated as platform nv counter and sip nv counter.. It is entirely possible that the SiP owns El3, S-EL2, but allows a platform owner to run secure partitions(which are isolated and lower privileged) be owned by a platform owner, that also signs the platform firmware ie non-trusted firmware like UEFI etc..What do you think of that split?",
