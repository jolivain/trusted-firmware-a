This is indeed a normal and expected behaviour for a hardware random number generator, so conditioning the numbers is the common solution.\n\u003e So the CRC patch should come before this one, actually.\n\u003e However the current implementation of the CRC patch fails with certain compilers, due to the used CRC intrinsics not being universal. So this would block this patch here until this is resolved.\n\n",
