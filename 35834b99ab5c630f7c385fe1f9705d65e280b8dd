      "message": "Could you please explain in the commit message why we need this?\n\nWe should say that until now we only supported describing through the CoT DTB bindings chains of trust with a single ROTPK so the signing key for root certificates was implicit.\n\nNow we want to extend that to describe CoTs with multiple roots of trust so we need a way to specify for each root certificate with which ROTPK it should be verified. For that, we reuse the \u0027signing-key\u0027 property already in use for non-root certificates but we make it optional for root certificates in single-RoT CoTs and for root certificates signed with the default ROTPK in multi-RoTs CoTs.",
