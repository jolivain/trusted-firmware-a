      "message": "Was it intentional to create a node by the name \"tb_fw-config\" under the node \"dtb-registery\" as well a node by the name \"tb_fw-config\" (at the same level as \"dtb-registry\"). I believe the second node should be named as \"tbbr-dyn-config\" since it captures the Trusted board boot configuration parameters.",

      "message": "tb_fw-config node is currently part of the fconf-config dtb, called \"fw_config\" (Firmware config). This is only the case to simplify the prototype, as \"fw_config\" reuses the \"tb_fw-config\" slot on the FIP. The \"tb_fw-config\" node point to \"itself\" (this dtb) to represent this.\nHaving an entry in dtb-registry for tb_fw-config will allow us to separate these two dtbs if needed in the future.\n\n\"fw_config\" dtb should be considered as the default entrypoint for fconf, as it holds the dtb-registry node, which references the other configs. It holds the configuration info for the full Firmware (bl1, bl2, bl31).\n\ntb_fw stands for \"Trusted Boot Firmware\", which is the name used in TBBR specification, and represents BL2 in TF-A. tb_fw-config is then the configuration for the trusted-boot firmware (BL2).\n\ntbbr-(dyn-config) would be \"Trusted Board Boot Requirements\" Dynamic configuration, which I found less appropriate.\n\nPlease let me know if this explanation is clear enough!",
