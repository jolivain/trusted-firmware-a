      "message": "In December I pushed a complete working driver stack for \"GICV3X\" build option, which supported GICv3.0, 3.1, 4.0 and 4.1. It also had global variables max PPIs, SPIs and actual number of register supported, but this patch was rejected on the basis that it was \"too\" big to review.\n2 months ago I pushed another patch which which was split in 2 but it was also rejected by the same reason. I was told to keep things as close to the existing design as possible \"to make it easier to review\" and add GIC_EXT_INTID option which when not will just give existing GICv3 driver.",

I feel with you when it comes to writing GIC code (I needed 11 revisions for the KVM ITS emulation code).\n\nAs mentioned below, a build time option might make sense, but we should at least limit the #ifdef\u0027s *in function bodies*, because it\u0027s hard to read, error prone, hard to debug and begs for compile time errors.
