      "message": "Why is this in assembly? Is it not possible to write an optimized version in C ?\nAlso, in the performance comparison, was the assembly version compared against an optimized C implementation or was it compared against the current implementation in Tf-A? Your commit message is not clear. This is common code used by many platforms and is being modified into something more complicated than necessary. If the complexity is necessary, i would like justification since this is code used by many platforms.\n\nA c version is more readable to the wider audience, more auditable and more maintainable.",
