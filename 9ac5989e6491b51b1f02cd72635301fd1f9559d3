Is it not possible to write an optimized version in C ?\nAlso, in the performance comparison, was the assembly version compared against an optimized C implementation or was it compared against the current implementation in Tf-A? Your commit message is not clear. This is common code used by many platforms and is being modified into something more complicated than necessary. If the complexity is necessary, i would like justification since this is code used by many platforms.\n\nA c version is more readable to the wider audience, more auditable and more maintainable.",

It says \"gets called\n71.84% of CPU execution time is spent in memset() function\nwritten in C using single byte write operations,\" That to me means you compared it against the existing TF-A version that writes byte by byte.\n\nWhat optimized version of memset did you use to compare, that was written in C?\nWhat testing was performed on this?\nThis is also common code and once again, it is being deprecated/replaced without notice. This can potentially have implications on static analysis tools. I\u0027m not aware of static analysis tools that work on assembly files. Please send out an email to the mailing list that you plan to replace it.",
