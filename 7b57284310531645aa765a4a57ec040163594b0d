      "message": "For Juno, when JUNO_AARCH32_EL3_RUNTIME is set, BL1 and BL2/BL2u are in AArch64 and BL32 is AArch32. \n\nHence I thought this line should have taken care of this. Unless BL2U is getting compiled in AArch32 mode which is a problem that needs to be fixed. BL1, BL2 and BL2U always should compile in AArch64 mode for JUNO. This is due to a system limitation related to reset vector.",
