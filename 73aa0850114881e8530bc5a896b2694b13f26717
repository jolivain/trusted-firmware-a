      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t say \"most\", it seems like all but a few of the options actually (somewhat prematurely) speak of numeric already. Definitely ENABLE_TRBE_FOR_NS does, I just see that ENABLE_SYS_REG_TRACE_FOR_NS and SPE don\u0027t - which should indeed be fixed in their respective patches. And FEAT_SB needs to be adjusted the other way.",
