      "message": "I am not sure if the fix is complete. On a successful FFA_VERSION invocation, the version is returned in X0 and x1-x7 must be zeros.\nx1 through x4 are cleared in lines 949 through 951 as part of spmd_smc_forward. However, x5, x6, x7 are forwarded unconditionally to NWd caller.\nIt just happens that the direct response for the framework message[1] from SPMC doesn\u0027t populate any values in arg4-arg7(i.e., x4 through x7). If for any reason x5/x6/x7 is non-zero(lets say due to a bug or as a metadata), these result registers x5/x6/x7 would not be MBZ which would be a violation of spec.\n\n[1] https://git.trustedfirmware.org/hafnium/hafnium.git/tree/src/arch/aarch64/hypervisor/handler.c#n406",
