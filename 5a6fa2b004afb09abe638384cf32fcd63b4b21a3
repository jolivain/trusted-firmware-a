      "message": "These entries look misplaced to me. The comment above mentions an ordering constraint:\n\n * The elements are ordered according to the image number stored in\n * tbbr_img_def.h, starting at index 1.\n\nThat being said, I notice that this is not the only infringement to this rule! The array looks correctly ordered until this entry:\n\n {\"nt-fw.cfg\",\t\tUUID_NT_FW_CONFIG},\n\nand then it\u0027s pretty random...\n\nCould you please get down to the bottom of it? Either this array needs fixing (and we need to add CI tests to cover this, as evidently that has gone unnoticed for some time), or the comment needs removing if it\u0027s not relevant.",
