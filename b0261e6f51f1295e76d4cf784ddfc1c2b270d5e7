      "message": "Hi Pali,\n\nI see that you\u0027ve commented on the patch that recently introduced this behaviour:\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/6127\n\nAs you probably know from the review above, the rationale for the original patch was to \"handle\" a dependency on a platform makefile. Pankaj Gupta (author of the above patch) needed the tool to be cleaned and rebuilt every time this platform makefile was changed.\n\nNow, I agree with you that this is by no means the right way to fix the issue. The right way would be through proper dependency tracking (through gcc -MD/-MT type of options). But as discussed in the code review above, this makefile already suffered from multiple problems around dependency handling before so we deemed that this was not making the situation much worse than before. Also, we reckoned that fiptool being such a small tool with few source files, rebuilding it every time would not have a big impact on people\u0027s workflows (Apparently we were wrong?) Hence we went for a quick and dirty fix.\n\nI don\u0027t think we should just revert Pankaj Gupta\u0027s patch because then we\u0027re back to square one for his problem. What would be preferable is a proper fix with proper dependency handling, as discussed above. Would you be willing to contribute such a patch instead?",
