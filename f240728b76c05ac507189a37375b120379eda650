      "message": "Huh, good point. Isn\u0027t that already an issue for QEMU now, which at least compiles for AArch32?\nI could just define different values dependent on whether TF is compiled for AArch64 or AArch32. Just not sure whether we also need to cover AArch64 TF-A with an AArch32 kernel.\n\nAlso: these function ID properties are just there for legacy reasons, to support kernels which only know about PSCI 0.1 (so really ancient ones). Any recent kernel will use PSCI 0.2, which uses fixed function IDs.",

Among other things, I would like to see a mention that dt_add_psci_node() will succeed (return 0) if the psci node already exists for example.",
