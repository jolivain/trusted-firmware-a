The Mbed TLS team recommends copying the declaration as a quick fix, but this should be followed by a proper fix of relying on `mbedtls_x509_crt_verify` or one of its variants instead of checking signatures manually. And if for some reason you really can\u0027t do that, make a feature request to expose the functionality that you need.",
