This is arguably a bit dodgy, but IIUC the common way to handle those cases? I think there are more advanced VAR_ARGS ways of handling default parameters, but they are probably a bit overkill here. And rewriting as two macros also sounds a bit over the top to me.\nAny suggestions?\nI don\u0027t think we can ignore it, as the CI will flag every subsequent patch.",
