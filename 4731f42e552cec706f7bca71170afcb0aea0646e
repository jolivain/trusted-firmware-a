As far as I can tell, there is no \"generic option\" in this file, a platform has to provide ${PLAT}_el3_spmc_logical_sp.c.\n\nAnd this makes perfect sense, since the logical partition should be filled with actual platform-specific stuff. For example, we could upstream the command to retrieve the serial number from the following patch as gpd.tee.deviceid.",
