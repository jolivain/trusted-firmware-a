Very rarely if there is an instance of doing a hardware fix for a specific version and introduces a new minor version in the middle, all comments may be broken and will need fix then. Number of minor versions remaining fixed is not a guarantee. I would follow the SDEN standard. For e.g. : Present in \"r0p0, r1p0, r2p0, r3p0, r3p1, r4p0, and r4p1\" instead of \"r0p0-r4p1\".",
