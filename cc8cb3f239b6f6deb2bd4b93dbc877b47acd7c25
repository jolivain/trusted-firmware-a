      "message": "This is not strictly true, and the original description is more accurate in this case. A \"good\" BL33 for testing is also subjective - for platform integrators TFTF is only useful for testing TF-A itself. Try to be certain about what images you do and do not need and when/why you need them (i.e. avoid \"probably\"): what do you need to use the FIP tool, and if a particularly common case requires BL33 then why and how does that relate to using the tool?",
