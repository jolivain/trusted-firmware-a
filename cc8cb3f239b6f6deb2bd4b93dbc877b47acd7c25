      "message": "This is not strictly true, and the original description is more accurate in this case. A \"good\" BL33 for testing is also subjective - for platform integrators TFTF is only useful for testing TF-A itself. Try to be certain about what images you do and do not need and when/why you need them (i.e. avoid \"probably\"): what do you need to use the FIP tool, and if a particularly common case requires BL33 then why and how does that relate to using the tool?",

      "message": "I moved the old bit about the FIP to the \"Image Terminology\" section (pretty much verbatim) and left a link to it, so I think that covers the question of what it is and why we need it. This bit should be in the central \"Image Terminology\" anyway as it\u0027s a notable omission. Maybe that could be expanded a little but I\u0027m not sure what with.\n\nAs for the BL33, you\u0027re right, I\u0027ll rephrase to something like \"if your platform requires a BL33\". However, we still need to provide some source of BL33. That was one of the pieces of feedback we got on 2.7 and I do agree. I agree \"good\" is a bad word to use, but maybe \"placeholder\"?",
