      "message": "Can\u0027t we use the existing `next_boot_source()` mechanism to implement this? Could you try loading images from the primary partition, if it fails select the backup partition in `next_boot_source()` then retry? Why do we need a different `plat_try_img_ops()` callback? How is it different from `next_boot_source()`?\n\nI might be missing something, as I feel I don\u0027t fully understand the existing `next_boot_source()` mechanism and the range of possibilities it offers. But in [PR#868](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/868) the use case of trying out multiple partitions seem to have been discussed, unless I misunderstood:\n\n\u003e You simply program the same fip image more than once. Then, if first portion of image is found to be valid it is loaded. Then if next portion of image is invalid(corrupted) io_retry is called and next copy of image is loaded.\n\u003e \n\u003e For paranoid users we have they actually program 4 copies of the image. Then 4 copies of a recovery image.\n\nThis is what makes me think this use case was considered and that we might be able to pull this off with the existing design.",
