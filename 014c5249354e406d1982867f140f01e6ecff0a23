      "message": "Hi Konstantin, just a FYI when you have a patch stack like this you can just run the CI on the top patch like this one and the CI will include for testing all the changes in the patches below in the relation chain. You do though then have to manually set the verified of these other patches assuming the CI passes.\n\nNo problem running the CI on each patch seperately apart from the extra load on the CI that may slow things down and risk overload that may cause infrastructure failures to creep in and of course your fingers clicking all those buttons :-) ",

      "message": "No worries! Trying to be helpful, not expecting the community to be aware of all the aspects to get the best out of the OpenCI. As more and more people are starting to use the CI I believe we need to hold a tech-forum in the new year to pass on some more guidance and tips about the OpenCI system. Look out for that in the new year either the live session or the recording if the time is inconvenient!!",
