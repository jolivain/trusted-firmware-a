As a general rule of thumb, all except those really supported by the SPMC at EL3 should be denied/unsupported in this case. the flaw in this approach is that most of this code was written assuming there is an SPMC that is making the SMC calls to EL3...\ni dont think even hafnium enforces that calls forwarded to SPMD does not have the spmc\u0027s id...need to check this.",
