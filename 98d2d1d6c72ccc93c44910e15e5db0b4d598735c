      "message": "Some overall comments,\n\n1. It is typical to have version and discovery SMC FIDs to be at the beginning of a Service range.  This is not followed in the current patch series. Any reason for this deviation ?\n\n2. The version and other discovery Functions need to be described in this document.\n\n3. There needs to a top level table mentioning the carveouts currently allocated to various services in TF-A. \n\n4. There needs to be a uniform scheme for the document. Currently it seems debugFS is expanded inline whereas PMF is outside the document. This needs some unification.",
