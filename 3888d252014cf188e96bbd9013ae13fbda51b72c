      "message": "Indeed BL31 is rooted into the CCA ROTPK under the CCA CoT but this does not necessarily hold true for other CoTs. For example, under the TBBR CoT, BL31 is signed by the Trusted World Key.\n\nSo I think we need some #ifdef ARM_COT_cca somewhere. I am just not sure at which level... IIRC, it is possible to use the TBBR CoT on AEM FVP with the RSS mocking layer and I am struggling to envisage all combinations and the consequences of setting the pk_oid field to ZERO_OID for each of these combinations... Could you please give it some thoughts?",

      "message": "Thank you for bringing this up. I was thinking that RSS\u0027s use-case would only occur during CCA CoT.\nWould it be possible to handle this in the following way -\n\n #ifdef ARM_COT_cca \n   #define BL31_KEY_OID    ZERO_KEYOID\n #else \n   #define BL31_KEY_OID    SOC_FW_CONTENT_CERT_PK_OID\n #endif\n\nSimilarly, wherever applicable, for other images.\nNow, let\u0027s see where we should put this information. Is it possible to create a new file \"include/tools_share/cot_oid.h\" to include these defines that can be beneficial for everyone?\nI can\u0027t see this as platform specific information. Thoughts?",
