      "message": "The trouble is, the indentation is so inconsistent throughout this makefile... I thought about using spaces but I didn\u0027t want to put 8 of them and make it look like a tabulation, as then it might become difficult to differentiate tabs from spaces, depending on how your text editor is configured. Another option could have been to use 2 spaces for example, in order to clearly mark the indentation but make it obvious it\u0027s not a tab, but I didn\u0027t see this pattern used anywhere else in this file and didn\u0027t want to make my own style rule. So I thought, let\u0027s keep it consistent with lines 23/25/33 and remove all spaces...",
