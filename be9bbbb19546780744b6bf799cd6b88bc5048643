      "message": "This function looks misplaced to me. IIUC the fact that the system is running in trial state has nothing to do with trusted boot per se. It is simply *called* by the trusted boot code to take some further decisions (in this case, deciding whether the non-volatile counter should be upgraded or not). I think this function should be provided by the FWU module instead.\n\nMoreover, I don\u0027t think this needs to be platform specific, right? The FWU spec simply says:\n\n The system is in the Trial state if any of the FW images in bankactive_index is pending acceptance\n\nwhich looks generic to me, it\u0027s just a matter of inspecting some fields of the FWU metadata, which contains no platform specific information.",
