      "message": "This function looks misplaced to me. IIUC the fact that the system is running in trial state has nothing to do with trusted boot per se. It is simply *called* by the trusted boot code to take some further decisions (in this case, deciding whether the non-volatile counter should be upgraded or not). I think this function should be provided by the FWU module instead.\n\nMoreover, I don\u0027t think this needs to be platform specific, right? The FWU spec simply says:\n\n The system is in the Trial state if any of the FW images in bankactive_index is pending acceptance\n\nwhich looks generic to me, it\u0027s just a matter of inspecting some fields of the FWU metadata, which contains no platform specific information.",

      "message": "In this patch series, FWU driver is quite tied up to Arm platform, and hence I added this function as a platform specific. \nI am looking into making the FWU module as generic as possible then will get rid of this platform specific function. Agree it should be generic as you mentioned.\n\nNote: Usage of this function comes under the trusted boot, hence I added platform function in this file which in turn calls function present in FWU module.",
