      "message": "I did some research and looks like this assert is incorrect. Platforms can place the BL32 image at a different address and there is no need for BL32_BASE to be populated with the right address. So I dont see any other option but to remove it from here.\n\nAs for the platform handler, I dont think that is required. The thought process is that the secure world ep_info is generated by the platform port anyways. So they would have placed the image at the right address and the PC is valid. Adding another handler to just check that PC is still valid, does not seem right to me.",
