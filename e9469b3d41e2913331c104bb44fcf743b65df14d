This patch implements handling of such a case.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marek Vasut \u003cmarek.vasut+renesas@gmail.com\u003e\nChange-Id: I3495241fb938e355352e817afaca8f01d04c81d2\n✖   subject must not be sentence-case, start-case, pascal-case, upper-case [subject-case]\n⚠   body\u0027s lines must not be longer than 72 characters [body-max-line-length]\n⚠   header must not be longer than 50 characters, current length is 74 [header-max-length]\n\n✖   found 1 problems, 2 warnings\nⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint\n\n⧗   input: refactor(plat/rcar3): Factor out DT memory node generation\n\nMove the code that adds single new memory@ node into the DT fragment passed\nto system software into separate function.

This functionality is disabled\nby default, set RCAR_GEN3_BL33_GZIP\u003d1 during build to enable it.\n\nThe BL33 at 0x50000000 should then be gzip compressed, however if\nthe BL33 does not have a valid gzip header, it is copied to the\ncorrect location and started as-is, this is a fallback for legacy\nsystems and systems which update to gzip-compressed BL33.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marek Vasut \u003cmarek.vasut+renesas@gmail.com\u003e\nChange-Id: Id93f1c7e6f17db1ffb952ea086562993473f6efa\n✖   subject must not be sentence-case, start-case, pascal-case, upper-case [subject-case]\n⚠   header must not be longer than 50 characters, current length is 63 [header-max-length]\n\n✖   found 1 problems, 1 warnings\nⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint\n\n",
