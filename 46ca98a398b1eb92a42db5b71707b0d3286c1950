      "message": "With this, anyone wanting to use the second UART will still either have to make their own \"flavor\", or claim they are a IOT2050 board. That\u0027s not necessarily a problem, but I wonder if it would be simple enough to allow at build time a flag like UART\u003dx on the make command line.\n\nThis might all have to get factored away when/if we add DT parsing support, then the default UART can be selected from a chosen node.",
