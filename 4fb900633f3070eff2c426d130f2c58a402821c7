      "message": "I\u0027m looking at this change and is seems that all files there (except marvell_plat_config.c) are 1:1 copy+paste from plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/t91/t9130 directory.\n\nThere are only some changes in marvell_plat_config.c file when comparing it with t9130.\n\nI would suggest to reuse code instead of copying files from directory to another. E.g. by adding compile time ifdefs in plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/t91/t9130/board/marvell_plat_config.c file for this CEx7 board. Or by creating proper abstraction of t9130 platform, so it can be extended also for other boards.\n\nI guess it is expected to see more cn913x boards in future and having same code and same files N times in TF-A tree is not something nice...",

      "message": "Same copy-paste issue is present in armada platforms, however I get your point. marvell_plat_config.c has substancial differences in the windows configuration, so ifdefs here would make it unreadable.\n\nHow about - using the new marvell_plat_config.c + Makefile pointing to t9130 files if unchanged?",

      "message": "I disagree with the original naming, as it exists only in the TF-A (nowhere in documentation, product description and so on). It is a Marvell platform though, so I\u0027m only saying my opinion.\n\nWRT the new platform - t9130 does not match the actual SoC and the SolidRun\u0027s product name. The convention of CN913X CEx7 Eval Board is kept throughtout TF-A, EDK2, U-Boot port, DTS and ACPI naming. Therefore I insist to use it as-is :)",
