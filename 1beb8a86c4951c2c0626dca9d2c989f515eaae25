      "message": "Hi Manish, I have in mind that disabling SVE/SME EL3 traps for SEL2/1/0 only has a limited set of use cases: SPMD + SPMC at S-EL2 or S-EL1.\nOther configurations (SPM-MM mainly) must keep Adv. SIMD/SVE/SME EL3 traps.\n\nIn which case I think it would be preferable transferring the responsibility to disable el3 traps to the SPMD.\nSimilarly to how the RMMD does it:\nhttps://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/services/std_svc/rmmd/rmmd_main.c#n139\n\nConsequently ENABLE_[SVE|SME]_FOR_SWD options become moot and I\u0027m targeting for removing them if possible.\n\nNote though those changes are still very much work in progress!",
