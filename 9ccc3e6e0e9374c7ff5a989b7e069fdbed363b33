      "message": "Generally, it would be beneficial to decouple any dependency between the SP manifest and TF-A. The manifest format is not standard and it can be SPMC specific.\nFrom TF-A\u0027s point of view the SP binary and the SP manifest are just two blobs. TF-A should pack these binaries into an SP package at build time and then load it to the required physical address without doing anything with the contents of the binaries.",
