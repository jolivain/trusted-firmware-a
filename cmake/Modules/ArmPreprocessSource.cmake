ArmPreprocessSource
-------------------

.. default-domain:: cmake

.. command:: arm_preprocess_source

Preprocess a file.

.. code-block:: cmake

    arm_preprocess_source(TARGET <target> OUTPUT <output>
                          SOURCE <source> LANGUAGE <language>
                          [INHIBIT_LINEMARKERS])

Creates a target ``<target>`` which preprocesses a source file ``<source>`` and
outputs the result to the path ``<output>``. The compiler used to preprocess the
file is determined by ``<language>``; specifically, via the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER <variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>` variable.

To pass preprocessor definitions, include directories or command line options to
the preprocessor, you can apply the following properties to the target
``<target>``:

 - :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS <prop_tgt:COMPILE_OPTIONS>`
 - :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <prop_tgt:COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>`
 - :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES <prop_tgt:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>`

For example, if you wish to preprocess a file ``foo.c`` with the preprocessor
definition ``-DFOO=BAR`` you might use:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Example usage
    :linenos:

    arm_preprocess_source(LANGUAGE C
        TARGET foo SOURCE "foo.c" OUTPUT "foo.c.i")

    set_target_properties(foo
        PROPERTIES COMPILE_DEFINITIONS "FOO=BAR")

The `INHIBIT_LINEMARKERS` flag inhibits linemarkers on compilers that produce
them by default. These are often intended by the preprocessor to communicate
source line information to the compiler, but can interfere with tools that do
not expect them.

.. note::

    The created target automatically inherits flags from the
    :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS <variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` and
    :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG> <variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>>`
    variables.

    # CMake's toolchain detection logic creates a special variable -
    # `CMAKE_<LANGUAGE>_CREATE_PREPROCESSED_SOURCE` - which describes the
    # command line required to preprocess a source file for that language. For
    # example, here it is for the GNU C preprocessor:

    #     <CMAKE_C_COMPILER> <DEFINES> <INCLUDES> <FLAGS> -E <SOURCE> >
    #     <PREPROCESSED_SOURCE>

    # bracket-surrounded names to variables we set. For example, `<DEFINES>`
    # is replaced with `@DEFINES@`. We then need to do some string replacement
    # magic to expand that string out to the value of the actual variable.
    #
    # The values for some of these, namely include directories, definitions
    # and other compiler options, come from properties set on the target by
    # the caller. These are typically taken from the target that this
    # preprocessed source file belongs to.
