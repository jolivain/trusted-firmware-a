Do you think DPE should be employed independently, without \u0027MEASURED_BOOT\u0027 support?\n\nAs far as I understand, \u0027MEASURED_BOOT\u0027 complements DPE support. DPE can be utilized with TPM for additional security, and certainly, it can operate on its own in systems lacking TPM or \u0027MEASURED_BOOT\u0027 support.",
