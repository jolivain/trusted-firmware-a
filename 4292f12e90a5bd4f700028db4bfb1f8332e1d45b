      "message": "Took a look at the fvp_topology.c file and also the recently introduced FCONF patch set. Previously even the FVP used to obtain it as done in this patch. It is only recently after FCONF was introduced did the FVP move al platform data to a dts.\n\nI intend do the same. But these changes will have to be done for all SGI/RD platforms and there are certain other things as well which we are now thinking of obtaining via dts after the introduction of FCONF. This can come in as a separate patch later which moves the platform topolgy to dts to be obtained via FCONF for all SGI/RD platforms.\nThanks",
