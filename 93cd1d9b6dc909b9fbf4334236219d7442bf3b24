      "message": "Please correct me if I am wrong. I understood as below:\n\n1. The \u0027plat_tbbr_img_def.h\u0027 header defines \u0027MAX_NUMBER_IDS\u0027 which includes all additional image IDs specific to the platform. \n2. Set SP image IDs (with SPD_spmd defined)  with the values already used by the platform-specific image IDs.(this seems wrong to me).\n\nIMO, \u0027plat_tbbr_img_def.h\u0027 header should redefine \u0027MAX_IMAGE_IDS\u0027  instead of setting \u0027MAX_NUMBER_IDS\u0027 and let the below implementation remains unchanged.",
