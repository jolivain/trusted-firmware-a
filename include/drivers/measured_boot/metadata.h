/*
 * Images, measured during the boot process, have some associated metadata.
 * One of these types of metadata is the image identifier strings. These macros
 * define these strings. They are used across the different measured boot
 * backends.
 * Note that these strings follow the standardization recommendations
 * defined in the Arm Server Base Security Guide (a.k.a. SBSG, Arm DEN 0086),
 * where applicable. They should not be changed in the code.
 * Where the SBSG does not make recommendations, we are free to choose any
 * naming convention.
 * The key thing is to choose meaningful strings so that when the measured boot
 * metadata is used in attestation, the different components can be identified.
