LAVA layer automatically re runs failed tests and if they pass on subsequent LAVA runs the ci-trustedfirmware.org Jenkins layer will report success.\n\nhttps://tf-ci-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tf-a-ci-pipeline-description describes the ci pipeline if you are curious. \n\nI have requests to have the qa-reports.linaro.org removed from the gerrit reporting as its confusing people. If we really need to go to this report it can be accessed from within the ci-trustedfirmware.org hierarchy of reports.",
