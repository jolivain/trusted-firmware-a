      "message": "No, we don\u0027t, but it also doesn\u0027t hurt. Javier has patches in the making that unconditionally change the DT, so we *will* need it in the future. Since I had this patch originally on top of Javier\u0027s, I left it to this way, to make this more future-proof. Leave it up to you whether you want to move it inside the if statement, just for now.\n\nBtw: If anyway knows of a better way of replacing the trailing newline with a 0 byte (to terminate the command line), without copying the whole thing, I am all ears. We can\u0027t overwrite the command line in place, since this memory is write-protected, after the FPGA tool has uploaded all payloads.",
