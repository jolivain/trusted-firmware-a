      "message": "I think that Varun has a point here. This function is specific to measuring an image, it knows how to get the image data from the input image id. I think that plat_mboot_measure() would have been more appropriate for a low level function that just measures a data buffer (taking a void* ptr and size of a buffer in argument).\n\nI am not too fond of the \"image\" terminology but that\u0027s how we name these things in TF-A so I vote for plat_mboot_measure_image() (just throwing the mboot_ namespace in the mix on top of Varun\u0027s suggestion).",
