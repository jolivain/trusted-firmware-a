The arch starts from this consideration that LSPs have similar properties whichever managed by the SPMC at same or lower EL.

As things stand, Nishant had done this work in context of the EL3 SPMC but we think it can extend to an SPMC at lower EL.\nWould you mind taking a look and let us know your opinion?\nhttps://review.trustedfirmware.org/q/topic:%22ns%252Fspmc_at_el3%22+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)\n(if that helps we can discuss live in one of our forum)",
