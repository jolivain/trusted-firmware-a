Admittedly we were using the RSB bus somewhat illegally there, but it worked, so could be considered a regression. Not sure if it\u0027s worth to bring back the I2C driver, and even decide between the two buses at runtime, or if we delegate this to crust and ignore the missing native PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF functionality.",
