      "message": "Hi Joanna,\n\nThe problem with changing the file name is that the code will become tied to cxc_google but in reality the code applies to Cortex-X1 in general. E.g. the errata workarounds are for Cortex-X1 in general and not specific to Cortex-X1 for Google. If another cortex_x1_cxc partner wants to use Cortex-X1, they will have to duplicate the code. Keeping the file names cortex_x1 but changing MIDR macro to include CXC_GOOGLE will allow any other partner to use the same code simply by adding their own macro for CXC_GOOGLE, without having to duplicate the code.\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve missed something in my understanding of this.",
