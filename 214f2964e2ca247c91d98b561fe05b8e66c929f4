      "message": "Hi Joanna,\n\nThe problem with changing the file name is that the code will become tied to cxc_google but in reality the code applies to Cortex-X1 in general. E.g. the errata workarounds are for Cortex-X1 in general and not specific to Cortex-X1 for Google. If another cortex_x1_cxc partner wants to use Cortex-X1, they will have to duplicate the code. Keeping the file names cortex_x1 but changing MIDR macro to include CXC_GOOGLE will allow any other partner to use the same code simply by adding their own macro for CXC_GOOGLE, without having to duplicate the code.\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve missed something in my understanding of this.",

      "message": "That is the point. At this time the code is cxc_google only.There is no generic instance of Cortex-X1 each one is licensed seperately through CXC. Although there may well be some commonality I think in theory there may not as well and as there is only the CTX Google instance at this time having upstream support added to TF-A I think it is best to just have a single file for this Cortex-X1 instance at this time. \n\nIf in future another is upstreamed I think it best to address any possible optimisation if necessary at that time.\n\nI\u0027m not so much concerned about macro names within those files as in any platform using an instance I believe only one would be selected.",
