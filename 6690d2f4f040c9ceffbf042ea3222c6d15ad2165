      "message": "I see the definitions of the functions below are more or less the same as the definitions in plat/arm/common/arm_io_storage.c. I was wondering if we can somehow split this (and arm_io_storage.c) file into two such that common functions can be placed in a shared source file. The difference btw 2 files seems to be the backend storage entity for structures such as policies (either a static c structure or from a device tree node through FCONF_GETTER). Just a thought. I am okay if we can do it in a different patch and I dont intend to stall this patch.",
