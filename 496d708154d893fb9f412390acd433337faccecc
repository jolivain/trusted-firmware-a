      "message": "Hi Amit,\n\nI take it we are not talking about the header order issue as I think your patchset 3 addresses that which we should see in the next CI run https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/19288/2..3/plat/xilinx/zynqmp/sip_svc_setup.c\n\nThe other failure is the newly added files. So here as this patch introduces 2 new files that need to be added to a CI patch for the build of this platform so the Coverity job will pass when run.\n\nIf you have done that just indicate a pointer to the patch and we can ignore this failure then.",

      "message": "Hi Joanna , \nThanks for reply. \nthe newly added file is buildable with existing CI scripts for xilinx zynqmp platform.\nReferring docs/process/contributing.rst section, tf-l1-build-plat and tf_config has zynqmp-* configuration files. so the new file custom_sip_svc.c is buildable with these already existing configuration and no other special CI configuration file is needed. Please let me know if i am missing some information.\n\nRegards\nAmit",

      "message": "I see. The purpose of this test is that the Coverity run is limited to a single run daily on integration branch so there are some scripts to check if newly added files are accounted for in the make file for the Coverity build. So it\u0027s trying to predict if we may have issues once patches are merged into that branch and try to get builds updated. In the past we were forever breaking the Coverity build and having to chase people to fix it.\n\nI guess the scripts are not intelligent enough to spot the use of wide cards.\n\nSounds like you are sure and we will soon find out if the Coverity build fails when this patch is merged.",
