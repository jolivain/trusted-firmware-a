      "message": "Hi Amit,\n\nI take it we are not talking about the header order issue as I think your patchset 3 addresses that which we should see in the next CI run https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/19288/2..3/plat/xilinx/zynqmp/sip_svc_setup.c\n\nThe other failure is the newly added files. So here as this patch introduces 2 new files that need to be added to a CI patch for the build of this platform so the Coverity job will pass when run.\n\nIf you have done that just indicate a pointer to the patch and we can ignore this failure then.",
