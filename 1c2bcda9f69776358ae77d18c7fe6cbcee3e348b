Since it\u0027s lacking an ERRATA_A57_XXX flag, I suspect it was intended as a functional flag, like on the a53, except there it was also an erratum mitigation. Since it\u0027s written as an erratum, I\u0027ve kept that and pigeonholed it into a number, assigning it 1, hoping that this will be obvious enough that something is funny about it.",
