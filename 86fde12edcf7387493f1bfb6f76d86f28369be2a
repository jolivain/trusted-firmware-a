You can measure config data and other things in different PCR\u0027s(as you have refer\u0027d to already in tcg.h). I assume that is left for future changes?",

Nobody other than you, who wrote the code, would know for sure without studying it closely that you can legally use this for data. There are no comments, the parameter names talk about only images.",
