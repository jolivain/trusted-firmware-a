      "message": "Just a small concern. Disclaimer: I am not very familiar with the corresponding linux fdt driver which reads this property.\n\nI believe the driver would locate(find the index) of cpu@0 node by querying for a node that has \"arm,cortex-a5\" as the \u0027compatible\u0027 property. Once it finds the node index, it will try to find the value of \u0027enable-method\u0027 property. However, since you moved this property to the parent node (i.e, cpus) , would the driver still work?",
