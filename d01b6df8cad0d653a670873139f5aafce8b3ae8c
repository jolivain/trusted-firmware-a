      "message": "I\u0027m not completely convinced that this clarifies the documentation more than it complicates it. The existing installation instructions do appear to already go over how to install the Python dependencies on line 40. I think unlike with binary dependencies like Python and PlantUML where we don\u0027t know what package manager the reader is using, we know exactly how to install Python dependencies, and we can integrate them into our installation instructions (like we\u0027ve done).\n\nI think adding additional information about the virtual environment and how to set one up for newbies is a good shout, but honestly I feel like the existing order looks less \"scary\" to people with no Python experience, who aren\u0027t going to know what \"these Python modules from this file are a prerequisite\" means.\n\nThat\u0027s my personal opinion, mind. Is this part of out-of-box testing?",
