      "message": "I am a bit confused... The static checks that are failing are:\n- warnings on outdated ARM copyrights. My understanding of an earlier comment from Varun ([1]) was that I should add a ProvenRun copyright rather than updating the old ARM copyright\n- issues with include order in plat/xilinx/common/include/pm_ipi.h file. However, this file is not modified by this patch set. I also do not see on master the stddef.h include which is listed in the static check message. Could you help me understand what is going on here?\n- some files added by the patch set are not covered by the coverty scan analysis. This should be the object of the change in [2]. Should I do something to this regard?\n\nThank you\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/11339/comment/c2e6af02_20e70304/\n[2] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/14540/3/script/tf-coverity/tf-cov-make#58",

      "message": "The Warnings are fine to ignore the check is simplistic and I think only checking the Arm Copyright. That we know that the extra copyright line has been added means you can ignore this.\n\nThe include file issue is indeed not related to this stack. A change has gone into integration branch earlier today causing this. So please ignore, we are addressing that seperately.\n\nThe main issue to address is the last one:\n\n****** Newly added files detection check for Coverity Scan analysis on patch(es) ******\n\nResult : FAILURE\n\n\nNew source files have been identified in your patch..\nservices/spd/pncd/pncd_common.c\nservices/spd/pncd/pncd_main.c\n\n1. Kindly ensure these newly added source files are covered by : \n   a. Coverity scan analysis by adding them to \"tf-cov-make\" build script with the appropriate build configurations. \n   b. Built as part of one of the platform configurations present in \"tf-l1-build-plat\" test group.\n\n   Please refer to the tf-a documentation for more detailed explanation. \n   \"https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html#add-build-configurations\"\n\n2. Please ignore if your files are already updated. Further the Code Maintainer will \n   resolve the issue by taking appropriate action.\n\nSo we use a Coverity scanner documented here https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html#add-ci-configurations that we can only run once a day and that requires some updates for new files added to the repo. If that not done we get an error reported. We try to get these done while the patch is under review so we are not chasing submitters after there patch is merged. Hopefully the 6.4 section clarifies what is required for a change in the CI repository. \n\nAlso we have a platform build job which is a second CI change. Although we cannot test at runtime a lot of partner/platform changes as we don\u0027t have the hardware we do platform builds so we can ensure any code submitted does build. This ensures any other change in common code etc at a latter date does not break that platform build.\n\nOnce done just indicate you have in the this patch and what the patch(s) is(are) we need to review and we can coordinate the merging of patches in TF-A and the CI Scripts repos.\n\nHTH",
