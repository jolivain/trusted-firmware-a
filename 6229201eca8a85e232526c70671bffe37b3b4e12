      "message": "I am a bit confused... The static checks that are failing are:\n- warnings on outdated ARM copyrights. My understanding of an earlier comment from Varun ([1]) was that I should add a ProvenRun copyright rather than updating the old ARM copyright\n- issues with include order in plat/xilinx/common/include/pm_ipi.h file. However, this file is not modified by this patch set. I also do not see on master the stddef.h include which is listed in the static check message. Could you help me understand what is going on here?\n- some files added by the patch set are not covered by the coverty scan analysis. This should be the object of the change in [2]. Should I do something to this regard?\n\nThank you\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/11339/comment/c2e6af02_20e70304/\n[2] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/14540/3/script/tf-coverity/tf-cov-make#58",
