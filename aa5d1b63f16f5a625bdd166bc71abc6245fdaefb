If you want to define putchar here I\u0027d maybe just make it an alias to console_putc without removing that.\n\nIf you do remove console_putc note that there are a lot of assembly files calling into it that you would all have to update.",

      "message": "Hi Julius,\n\nI would like to move this to make libc closer to what it is supposed to be; a library. Currently it has dependencies to platform/project specific functions.\n\nThere are currently only two assembly files which have references to console_putc:\nplat/nxp/common/aarch64/ls_helpers.S\nplat/common/aarch32/crash_console_helpers.S\n\nI assume these could be removed like they have been on other platforms.",
