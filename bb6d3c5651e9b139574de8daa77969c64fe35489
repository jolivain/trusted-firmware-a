Even in the Linux kernel, I see people using different styles across files.\n\nHere is an example where function arguments are aligned: \nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/cpu.c#n148\n\nAnd here is another one where they\u0027re not:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/exit.c#n269\n\nI am just worried that this patch will generate some noise in the git history, which might be down to personal style preference in the end...",
