      "message": "Thank you for spotting this. This somehow got mixed up in the refactor, I\u0027ve updated the patch to fix this and match the expected setup flow.\n\nThe aim here should be to use the required values as part of populating the FF-A boot protocol information that we had populated in the ep_info struct during earlier setup. After this is complete we can clear them and start populating the known values.\n\nIn the case that the FF-A boot protocol is not required, then the thinking is that we shouldn\u0027t need the existing values so we can clear them before we start populating with any other values in the EL specific or potential platform hook, as mentioned in my other comment, functions.",
