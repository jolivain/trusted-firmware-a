If you place your setup in cm_manage_extensions_el3 then you can control each security\u0027s context easily and the context restore routine knows which security state it\u0027s going towards (I think? please double check). Then you can just treat it as a proper global.\n\nIn the assembly you can just reference the name and the linker will figure it out for you so no pointer necessary.",
