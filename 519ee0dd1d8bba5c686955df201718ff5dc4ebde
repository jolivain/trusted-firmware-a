      "message": "But this wfi() will realistically prevent the error message and panic from ever occurring, even when the sunxi_cpu_off() call fails? I wonder if we should move the mandatory wfi into the implementation of sunxi_cpu_off(), to be called only when needed (when powering ourselves off via direct ARISC code). That wouldn\u0027t really change anything, but at least would make this code here look less wrong.",
