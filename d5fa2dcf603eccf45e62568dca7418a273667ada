      "message": "Andrey, many thanks for pushing for the LTO patches, and for coming back to this patch!\nIt should be noted that the LTO trick is not enough for every compiler: on Ubuntu 20.04\u0027s GCC 9.4 it still overflows by 216 bytes. But it seems to work with Debian\u0027s 12.2.0. I had no luck with any of the non-libc compilers from kernel.org, though.\n\nAnd it\u0027s a shame that we cannot enable LTO in the platform.mk. @Jayanth, how hard would this be to change?",

      "message": "Oh sorry, I didn\u0027t mean you should do the work and evaluate LTO for other platforms. It just looks odd to have platform specific definition in a generic Makefile helper, especially if we have platform specific Makefiles already.\nBut that doesn\u0027t need to be solved by you, it\u0027s more a general question to people caring about the build system, why this doesn\u0027t work in the first place and how this could be fixed.",
