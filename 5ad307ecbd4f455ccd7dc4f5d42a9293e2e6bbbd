      "message": "Hi Yann,\n\nThis patch did not pass the regression tests. Could you please have a look at the failures and fix them if you can? (see http://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-gerrit-tforg-l1/416/)\n\nI had a quick look myself and AFAICS there are 3 failures:\n\n* A build test failure: https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/173010/console\nThis is failing at link time. It seems that the stm32mp1 platform port hit the memory limit:\n\n arm-none-eabi-ld.bfd: /home/buildslave/workspace/tf-a-builder/trusted-firmware-a/build/stm32mp1/debug/bl2/bl2.elf section `xlat_table\u0027 will not fit in region `RAM\u0027\n arm-none-eabi-ld.bfd: BL2 image has exceeded its limit.\n arm-none-eabi-ld.bfd: region `RAM\u0027 overflowed by 4096 bytes\n Makefile:1116: recipe for target \u0027/home/buildslave/workspace/tf-a-builder/trusted-firmware-a/build/stm32mp1/debug/bl2/bl2.elf\u0027 failed\n\nYou might need to reorganize how the BL images are laid out in Trusted SRAM (tweaking BL2_LIMIT and friends) to fix this.\n\n* A Juno run config failure: https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/173107/\nI think this one might be unrelated to your patch. I\u0027ll get back to you on this one.\n\n* An FVP build failure: https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/173116/console\nI think this is unrelated to your patch again, your patch stack just needs a rebase on the latest integration branch to fix this issue. Could you please do that?",
