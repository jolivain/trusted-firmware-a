TFA will then have to be started on the warm boot path and it will have to restore its own context.\n\nThe point of TFA being in SRAM is performance and for us security. If you copy out to DDR and back with no encryption/authentication you lose that. The easier method would be to have just had TFA run out of DDR in the first place here.",

If that\u0027s the case, then TFA can still be run from anywhere. The only absolute address added is where to store the TFA context. Indeed, it can\u0027t be just anywhere, as it has to reside in DDR because any other memory location would result in data loss. As for the memory location, we need to have a fixed address in order to be able to restore it during a resume, and we also need to share its location with other components of the system to ensure that no one else will write to it. I don\u0027t see how a regression could be introduced, as this region is only used when K3_PM_SYSTEM_SUSPEND is enabled for the j7200.

On J7200 this could either be DMSC or TFA itself. For TFA itself you would have to reload a fresh copy using the normal methods (certificate loading) and then TFA will detect that it is on a resume path in early start and reload its old context (which should just be just the data area, code/rodata sections should be read-only and will be the same).\n\nLastly, the area in DDR you save this to cannot be hard-coded here, not because of PIE (I think we are confusing topics here), but because we cannot be sure that memory is firewalled and reserved from other users. You will have to communicate the chosen area to U-Boot/Linux (via DT carveout) and also ensure it is firewalled (using the certificate that wraps TFA). In which case this can be set a build time by the system integrator, if you make this location a build time option it would be more acceptable (I\u0027m still not 100% onboard here, but much better than hard-coded).",
