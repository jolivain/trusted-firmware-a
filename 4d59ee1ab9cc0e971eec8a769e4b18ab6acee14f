      "message": "That is an interesting point. The guidance here is for the SPMC to return it\u0027s version number if it thinks that it is possible to interoperate with the caller e.g. a minor version difference. My interpretation was that if the version is sufficiently different that the SPMC cannot support it, there would be little difference in behavior between an incompatible version and no support at all. Do you have some other behavior in mind here?",
