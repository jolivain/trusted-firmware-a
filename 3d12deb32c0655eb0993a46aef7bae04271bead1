      "message": "I am afraid introducing STM32 specific code in a generic file like drivers/fwu/fwu.c is not acceptable, as this will become hard to maintain over time if all platforms follow this pattern...\n\nIf there is a need to let platforms decide what do when we fail to load the FWU metadata then this should go through some kind of platform interface. Perhaps we can introduce a new plat_fwu_post_metadata_load() interface, that each platform can tailor to their needs. Or maybe fwu_init() as a whole needs to be converted as a platform hook. This needs more thoughts and discussion.",
