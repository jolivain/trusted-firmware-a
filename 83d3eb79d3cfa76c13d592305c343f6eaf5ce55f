      "message": "Well, it looks easy enough, and I tried a macro before, but I will later extent that function, to check for unsupported features, and this gets more messy.\nIn general I like to follow the rule of \"Write C, not preprocessor.\" here, which gives us better type checking and compiler visibility.\nIf you don\u0027t mind, I will keep it like this for now. Since it\u0027s a single function, it\u0027s also a simple change in the future, should this be required.",
