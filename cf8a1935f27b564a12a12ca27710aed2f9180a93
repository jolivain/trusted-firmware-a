      "message": "The a710, X3, and N2 had a type of errata [1] that caused similar problems. At the time we decided that the for the purposes of those errata, calling into the panic handler would eventually lead to this wfi loop and we would be okay with the occasional panic messages on the rare event the errata were encountered. Since then we have discovered that the TRMs of newer CPUs (like this one) have had their powerdown sequences updated with the possibility of a wfi not being final. As such we decided that panicing on that wakeup is not desirable and tf-a should just retry the powerdown (this loop).\n\nI believe the plan is to get a few of the platforms that have this same code sequence call into this function eventually. The background is in [2].\n\n[1]: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17157/5 (top of patchstack)\n[2]: https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/archives/list/tf-a@lists.trustedfirmware.org/message/FTOVSXNHYLVYYJT3HZOQJGT5H2S2ROYA/",
