      "message": "Hi Olivier,\nThanks for sharing this.\n\nFor the first error b61d94a1a::services/std_svc/spm/common/include/spm_common.h:\nI am not making any change in this file so I don\u0027t think this needs to fixed in this patch.\n\nFor the second error, in these patches we are shifting from RESET_TO_BL31 to TBB boot flow. I think the build in the CI is not using certain files and hence seeing this error. Once these patches are merged, I plan to re-enable the CI with proper build flags. Is it possible to ignore this error for now?",
