      "message": "Hi Marek,\nThanks for your patch. However I won\u0027t accept it. The issue you have is that you want to build BL2 with all the possible boot devices. This is not recommended (https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_configure_TF-A_BL2#Build_command_details), as we\u0027ll run out of space as SYSRAM is only 128kB for STM32MP13. And this patch does not care about the features that will be upstreamed, and the other build configuration like TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT\u003d1 or ENCRYPT_BL32\u003d1. That\u0027s why we recommend to build one BL2 per boot device, to be able to reduce code and DT (through overlay fdts/stm32mp13-bl2.dtsi).\n\nI will update the doc for this recommendation, as the information should belong here, and not only in ST wiki.",
