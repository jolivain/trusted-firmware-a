This is not recommended (https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_configure_TF-A_BL2#Build_command_details), as we\u0027ll run out of space as SYSRAM is only 128kB for STM32MP13. And this patch does not care about the features that will be upstreamed, and the other build configuration like TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT\u003d1 or ENCRYPT_BL32\u003d1. That\u0027s why we recommend to build one BL2 per boot device, to be able to reduce code and DT (through overlay fdts/stm32mp13-bl2.dtsi).\n\nI will update the doc for this recommendation, as the information should belong here, and not only in ST wiki.",

There are some work on upcoming STM32MP2 to reduce memory footprint, I hope we can benefit on some to reduce memory footprint on STM32MP13.\n\n\u003e \u003e This is not recommended (https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_configure_TF-A_BL2#Build_command_details), as we\u0027ll run out of space as SYSRAM is only 128kB for STM32MP13.

But I think it is a DT specific to your board, that\u0027s why I cannot reproduce. Maybe you use the same DT as OP-TEE or Linux? In TF-A we try to only keep nodes that have an interest for TF-A itself to reduce the DTB size. So the stm32mp135f-dk.dts here is reduced compared to Linux or OP-TEE ones. Maybe that could explain your issue? I agree we are closed to the 16kB allocated to DTB, and other may face the same issue as yours. I\u0027ll check if we can increase the DTB size by 4kB, but I know that all our use-cases won\u0027t fit if we increase it to 28kB.\n\n\u003e \u003e I will update the doc for this recommendation, as the information should belong here, and not only in ST wiki.",
