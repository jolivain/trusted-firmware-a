      "message": "Going through the static check failures, I came across this:\n```\n8d32fc2d3::plat/nvidia/tegra/common/tegra_bl31_setup.c:\nInclude ordering error, order should be:\n\t#include \u003ctrusty/plat/boot_args.h\u003e\n\n\t#include \u003ctegra_private.h\u003e\n```\nhowever placing those includes in that order would result in:\n```\n#include \u003ctegra_def.h\u003e\n#include \u003ctegra_platform.h\u003e\n#ifdef SPD_trusty\n#include \u003ctrusty/plat/boot_args.h\u003e\n#endif\n#include \u003ctegra_private.h\u003e\n```\nwhich seems to violate the include-ordering rules as described in  https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-style.html#include-statement-ordering since \"trusty/plat/boot_args.h\" comes alphabetically *after* \"tegra_private.h\"\nIs the tool broken and/or confused by the conditional include, or am I misunderstanding the ordering rules?",
