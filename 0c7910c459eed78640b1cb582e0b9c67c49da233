      "message": "Ok to help get this stack moving again post v2.8 I\u0027ve rebased all the stack and will se CI runs going to see what that flushes out. I\u0027m afraid there may be some false failures at the moment on the OpenCI but we can help filter them from anything specific to this stack.\n\nI see various other ongoing discussion on some of the patches in this stack that needs to be resolves and I see Joao has tried to provide guidance on some of these but others are -1 MR/CR from other reviewers that needs dealing with.\n\nXmas break is fast approaching so lets see if we can resolve remaining issues before folks start disappearing.",

      "message": "On the include ordering front, I\u0027ve been unable to find something that pleases the include ordering checker. I think this is because the #include in question is a relative path to an include file that is local to Trusty SPD.\nNote that this was already the case, presumably since before the include ordering rule went into effect.\nThe problem here is that the location of that include file in Trusty SPD changed, so it needs to be updated for https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/17038, triggering the order check in that Xilinx file for the first time.",
