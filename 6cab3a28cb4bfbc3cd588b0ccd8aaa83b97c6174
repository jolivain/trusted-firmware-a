We run it on a daily basis.\n\nCI will not be able to identify your tf-a-scripts patch addressing coverity issue, while we run AllowCI+1 on this patch, code owners and maintainers will manually verify and add the vote.\n\nSo once the tf-a-ci-scripts patch is in place, I will manually overide the verified -1 vote here and give +1 vote.\n\nFrom your side, please keep both the patches with the same topic_name: (enable-qemu-sdei), so that mainatiners will merge both together.\nHope its clear.",
