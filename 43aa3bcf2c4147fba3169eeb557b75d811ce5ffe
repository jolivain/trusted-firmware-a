      "message": "Its possible that new OIDs can be added in future but for platform specific you can use some uniqe value. TBBR spec only talks about reserved Object Id values for X.509 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0006/latest (appendix C), which is already present in this file, Anything other than this should be fine.\nMay be you can start with 1.3.6.1.4.1.4128.2200.1 for NXP platform.\n\nAnother question, As mentioned by Mark https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/6167/19, it seems you are missing \"platofrm_oid.h\" in your patchset?",
