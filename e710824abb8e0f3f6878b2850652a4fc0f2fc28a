      "message": "I have a question about a corner case which could seem like illegal. \nWhat happens if someone compiles TF-A with ENABLE_FEAT_SEL2\u003d1 from command line when ARM_ARCH_MINOR is \u003c 4? I believe the compiler will emit instructions related to SEL2 extensions but CPU will encounter exception when it executes them. Would it be possible to provide a build assertion ? something like this:\nif (major.minor \u003c 8.4) \u0026\u0026 FEAT_SEL2\u003dENABLED \n      ERROR(\"FEAT_SEL2 needs 8.4 extensions enabled\");\nendif",
