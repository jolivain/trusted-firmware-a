      "message": "Hey Andre, this offset doesn\u0027t seem to be working. Function el3_exit in context.S uses offset CTX_GPREGS_OFFSET + CTX_GPREG_LR to load the return address into x30, which is not the same as CTX_EL3STATE_OFFSET + CTX_ELR_EL3. \nI\u0027m working on the TFTF test for this and found out that the exception is always returning to the instruction that caused it, since the return address is not being updated properly.",
