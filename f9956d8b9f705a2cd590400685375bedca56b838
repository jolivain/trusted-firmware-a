Note that we\u0027re switching over suite-\u003eval instead of ret.\n\nExactly. That\u0027s what I tried to explain in the comment at lines 23-26.\n\nrun_tests() !\u003d 0 means we could not run some of the tests, because of some internal test framework error.\nrun_tests() \u003d\u003d 0 means that we could run all tests but it does not tell anything about tests results. For that we still need to look at individual retest results into suite-\u003eval, as Jimmy pointed out.\n\nIOW, the return value check from run_tests() above is correct.",
