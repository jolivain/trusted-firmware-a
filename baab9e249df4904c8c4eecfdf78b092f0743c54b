      "message": "Maybe better to just remove the #if COREBOOT from here and put it directly into rockchip_get_uart_xxx()? The coreboot_serial global stays accessible for the whole runtime of the system, including across suspend_resume, so you don\u0027t need to save that stuff away anywhere else. (Would still need to check for the case that no UART is configured here, though. I used coreboot_serial.type, but checking baseaddr !\u003d 0 should work just as well and makes sense for both versions.)",
