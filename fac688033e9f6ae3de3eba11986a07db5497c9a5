      "message": "In the intent to reduce the amount of duplicated code, I think there would be value in moving this helper function into the generic authentication framework. Then the default crypto lib (drivers/auth/mbedtls/mbedtls_crypto.c) could call it from verify_hash() and so could any platform-specific crypto library, like yours. I imagine this is a common use case for crypto libs based on hardware crypto accelerators.\n\nWhat do you think? I could not see anything specific in your implementation, except you\u0027re assuming a SHA-256 digest, which I suppose could be enforced outside of this helper function?\n\nSame comment would apply to get_plain_pk_from_asn1().",
