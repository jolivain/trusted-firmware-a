      "message": "Sorry I did not fully understand the problem you were facing. What registers were overwritten by plat_core_pos_by_mpidr()? Caller-saved registers, i.e. x9-x15? I am guessing the early boot code calling this function relied on x9-x15 to be preserved across the call? If this is right, wouldn\u0027t it be better from a maintenance perspective to save these registers before calling plat_core_pos_by_mpidr() and restoring them after the call, instead of re-implementing the function in assembly language?",
