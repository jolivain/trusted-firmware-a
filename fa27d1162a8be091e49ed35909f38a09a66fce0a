      "message": "I suppose there\u0027s the question of whether we should make use of the oss-security list (https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/) more generally (rather than just for this latest vulnerability as requested by the reporter). I don\u0027t see a strong benefit to this; the TF-A list seems good enough and monitoring that high-traffic list would be onerous for us. Happy to hear other opinions, though.",

      "message": "I think oss-security list could help in reaching more people. People that don\u0027t necessarily work on TF-A on a day to day basis so they don\u0027t bother subscribing to the project\u0027s development mailing list, but still they are interested to hear about TF-A security issues.\n\nWhy would we need to monitor the list? Is it not enough to monitor answers to our own posts when we announce a new vulnerability? In this case, it does not seem that onerous to me.",

      "message": "Regarding the monitoring, I guess I was concerned about the risk of TF-A vulnerabilities getting reported to oss-security without the knowledge of TF-A-Security, but I suppose that risk is already there and wouldn\u0027t get worse if we started using that list.\n\nSo I have no objections to to using oss-security. Perhaps this is worth a wider discussion with all the tf.org security teams?",
