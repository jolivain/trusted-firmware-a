      "message": "I am squishing an above patch into this one. Pasting the @Soby\u0027s comment here since I will abandon it:\n\nSoby:\nhmm, this is where the changes done so far is going to affect performance. If some of the enables can be made static inlines in a header, then the performance impact of bl, ret can be avoided.\nThis comment is not blocking this patch, Will leave it to other reviewers if this is something we need to cater for as part of this work\n\nBoyan:\nI only want to point out that this will only run once per core. Also, the majority of the code would have ran in an identical way anyway but at cm_prepare_el3_exit(). Example is the amu enablement which is terribly complex.\n\nIn any case, I would be happy for suggestions.\n\nSoby:\nIts actually run once per-suspend-per-core (which can be about 10s of times per second per CPU depending on workload). But I think , if the JUNO TFTF performance tests do not have any perceptible difference, this is OK and can be picked up for optimization later.",
