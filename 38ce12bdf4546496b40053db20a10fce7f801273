      "message": "`include/plat/common/platform.h` is for definitions common to all platforms. I am afraid there cannot be any rcar-specific things in there. This is not the right place for this, rcar-specific definitions should go into the rcar platform layer.\n\nThat being said, there already exists a common platform API that does exactly what you want AFAICS: `plat_is_my_cpu_primary()`. See the documentation [here](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/porting-guide.html#function-plat-is-my-cpu-primary-mandatory-when-cold-boot-single-cpu-0).",

      "message": "There cannot be rcar-specific code in the generic PSCI library. This has to be implemented in another way.\n\nLet me check my understanding about what you are trying to achieve here... IIUC, you\u0027d like to:\n- Reject system suspend requests on non-boot CPUs.\n- Reject CPU off requests on the boot CPU.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nCould you please elaborate on the targeted use case? The commit message provides some hint about CPU off requests (although I\u0027d like more details please) and does not mention anything about system suspend on non-boot CPUs...\n\nBy getting a better understanding of what you are trying to achieve and why, we will be in a better position to advise on how this should be implemented in TF-A.",
