      "message": "Hi Varun,\nThis is a valid observation. This is legacy from when the Hafnium project has been transferred to TF-A team\u0027s responsibility. This SPMC design doc has been committed there by convenience. I had in mind to move this doc and the SPMC threat model to the hafnium tree docs directory:\nhttps://git.trustedfirmware.org/hafnium/hafnium.git/tree/docs\nBut this requires a bit of re-organization because the documents already sitting there relate to the legacy Hafnium NS EL2 hypervisor design.\nLet me check internally first if this move is okay with everybody.\nMeanwhile, can we consider progressing the current change? As it is a doc contents improvement (related to memory sharing) independent from the above considerations about the documents location. Thanks.",
