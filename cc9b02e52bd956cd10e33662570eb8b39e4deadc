      "message": "But this is switching to a different way of reserving memory, right? From the /reserved-memory *DT node* (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt) to that now somewhat deprecated /memreserve/ special FDT feature? At the very least this deserves some comment in the commit message.\nBut actually I wonder if we should keep the node version, but enhance the code to properly detect overlaps, and merge them?",

      "message": "Yes, and that is the trick to make things work: The kernel uses memreserve already (probably just like for rpi3), and we cannot put reserved-memory over that any more. See https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/6a283aef-388d-c300-8304-503bc88a4dcf@siemens.com/ for more background.",
