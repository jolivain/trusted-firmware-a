      "message": "But this is switching to a different way of reserving memory, right? From the /reserved-memory *DT node* (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt) to that now somewhat deprecated /memreserve/ special FDT feature? At the very least this deserves some comment in the commit message.\nBut actually I wonder if we should keep the node version, but enhance the code to properly detect overlaps, and merge them?",

      "message": "Yes, and that is the trick to make things work: The kernel uses memreserve already (probably just like for rpi3), and we cannot put reserved-memory over that any more. See https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/6a283aef-388d-c300-8304-503bc88a4dcf@siemens.com/ for more background.",

      "message": "Yeah, so I think the proper solution would be to remove the /memreserve/, since that is no longer needed for the secondaries\u0027 spin-tables (they are now spinning in TF-A).\nAnd then replace this with the /reserved-memory node, since we (theoretically) need the stronger no-map property to prevent speculation into secure memory. (On the RPi this doesn\u0027t matter, since we cannot make this real secure memory, but still we should at least try to do the right thing).\nI will look into it this week, unless you beat me to it.",
