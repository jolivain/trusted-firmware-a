      "message": "Alright, that makes sense for the heap. Doesn\u0027t this become a sort of a backdoor to disable measured boot? The presence or absence of the dtb file dictates whether a measurement will be written by the ROM or not. ROM should unconditionally write the measurement of BL2, when measured boot is enabled, no?",
