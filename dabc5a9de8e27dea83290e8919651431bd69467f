      "message": "Is this line required?\n\nMy understanding is that this is already called by stm32mp1_security_setup(), which is called before configuring the GIC in sp_min_platform_setup(). In this context, is it actually possible to receive this interrupt before tzc400_init() has been called?\n\nI guess the idea might have been that we might as well call it just in case, because there is no harm in calling it twice and tzc400_it_handler() relies on the TZC-400 driver\u0027s internal data to be initialized to generate a meaningful report in debug builds?",
