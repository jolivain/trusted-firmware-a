      "message": "Unrelated to your patch, but why are you (and every other platform, it seems) doing this? libfdt.mk uses MAKE_LIB, which as far as I can tell builds it into a separate library and automatically adds -lfdt to LDFLAGS. So this really should already link correctly out of the box (by just including the Makefile), without having to additionally link the sources into the main binary as well. If it doesn\u0027t, maybe that\u0027s a bug that needs to be fixed in the build system -- this, at least, doesn\u0027t look like the right solution.",
