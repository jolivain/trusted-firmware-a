      "message": "The issue here is that without the libfdt.mk, the include path for libfdt.h is missing as well and thus the header can\u0027t be found. Making that an explicit \u003clib/libfdt/libfdt.h\u003e works on one level but then fails at the next include:\n\ninclude/lib/libfdt/libfdt.h:54:10: fatal error: libfdt_env.h: File or Directory not found\n #include \u003clibfdt_env.h\u003e\n\nSo looks like we\u0027ll need to keep that ifdef",

      "message": "Unrelated to your patch, but why are you (and every other platform, it seems) doing this? libfdt.mk uses MAKE_LIB, which as far as I can tell builds it into a separate library and automatically adds -lfdt to LDFLAGS. So this really should already link correctly out of the box (by just including the Makefile), without having to additionally link the sources into the main binary as well. If it doesn\u0027t, maybe that\u0027s a bug that needs to be fixed in the build system -- this, at least, doesn\u0027t look like the right solution.",
