      "message": "Update from Joanna for the build failures -\u003e  https://ci.staging.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/17186/console\n\n\"My quick reading is that there has been some changes since v2.8 on this Arm reference platform https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/log/?qt\u003dgrep\u0026q\u003dCSS_SGI_PLATFORM_VARIANT  with the last change adding a new variant. and in TFTF there is a change to the testing https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/tf-a-tests.git/commit/?id\u003d8305433b56607dce8f1f1bcf394e2bd155921ec5. So I guess this failure is a consequence of using the TF-A LTS branch with the tip of tree TFTF. Hopefully this type of issue will not occur once a v2.8 version of TFTF is use in the LTS CI config Paul is setting up.\"",
