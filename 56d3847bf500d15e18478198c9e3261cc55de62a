      "message": "That was the original plan. The issue is that in that case there would be a branch in the certificate chain (AP_BL2 is the parent of BL32 and BL33 as well):\n - RoT Cert -\u003e Plat Cert -\u003e AP FW. Cert -\u003e AP Secure Cert\n - RoT Cert -\u003e Plat Cert -\u003e AP FW. Cert -\u003e Hyper Cert\n \nWhen U-Boot queries the certificate chain with a handle referring to the Hyper Cert then the SP Secure Cert would be omitted, which is unfortunate. Of course, if some platform wants to structure their chain like this it is possible and allowed. But in that case, a handle referring to the AP Secure Cert must be handed off to U-Booot. To make it capable of querying that sub-chain as well. Furthermore, the verifier must handle two sub-chains (whose first part is overlapping) to have an overall picture of the system\u0027s status.\n\nWe opted for a simpler approach.",
