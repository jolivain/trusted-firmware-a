      "message": "Hi Levi,\n\nThanks for your contribution! There appear to be a few inconsistencies between TF-A and the current state of the handoff spec. The register convention was recently modified to account for the 4-byte wide signature [1]. As you rightly point out, the previous convention didn\u0027t have a wide enough field to accomdate the entire signature. The spec now mandates:\n\nX1 is divided into the following fields:\n\n    X1[31:0]: set to the TL signature (4a0f_b10b)\n    X1[39:32]: version of the register convention used. Set to 1 for the AArch64 convention specified in this document.\n    X1[63:40]: reserved, must be zero.\n\nFor that reason, I think all we need to update is REGISTER_CONVENTION_VERSION_MASK. \n\n[1] https://github.com/FirmwareHandoff/firmware_handoff/blob/main/source/register_conventions.rst#aarch64-receiver",
