It\u0027s easy to miss with all the spam from the validation bot!\n\nQuestion by Sandrine:\nWhat is the build command line you\u0027re using?\n\nI\u0027m trying to better understand how you hit this problem, as we\u0027ve never encountered it on Arm platforms, despite testing a combination of different crypto algorithms and key sizes in the CI loop.\n\nI remember that the set of build options for configuring key sizes, hash sizes and the like is rather confusing. E.g. to choose the crypto algo, there\u0027s TF_MBEDTLS_KEY_ALG (documented here: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/auth-framework.html#the-cryptographic-library) and there\u0027s also KEY_ALG (documented here: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/build-options.html) and it is hard to understand which one has precedence or how they interact together. Hence I suspect that you might not be using the \"right\" set of build options (and as I said, it would be completely understandable!).\n\nAnswer:\n\nBuild Command:\nexport PLAT\u003dlx2162aqds\nmake all fip pbl PLAT\u003d$PLAT BOOT_MODE\u003dflexspi_nor RCW\u003d./rcw_2000_650_2900_17_2.bin BL33\u003d./u-boot-lx2160aqds.bin SPD\u003dopteed BL32\u003dtee_lx2.bin TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT\u003d1 CST_DIR\u003d../../apps/security/cst/ GENERATE_COT\u003d1 MBEDTLS_DIR\u003d../mbedtls/\n\nFor better understanding of options, I am using please refer the file \"plat/nxp/common/tbbr/tbbr.mk\" part of the patch#6157.\nIn this file following flags are defined:\n    KEY_ALG\t\t:\u003d rsa\n    KEY_SIZE\t\t:\u003d 2048\n\nThanks\nPankaj",
