      "message": "Thanks for this cleanup patch Andre.\n\nJust sharing the reasoning behind the existing documentation of FEATURE_DETECTION  macro.\n\" I agree that FEATURE_DETECTION flag is no more completely having its influence on dynamic runtime check.\nInitially, our thoughts was to bring in feature check(reading ID_register) early at the boot phase under detect_arch_features( ) and stop boot if any errors.\nIf not, then go for dynamic runtime check if ENABLE_FEAT_STATE\u003d2.\nThe current implementation, no longer follows this pattern, as we even cover FEAT_STATE_CHECK, in detect_arch_features( ) api.\"\n\n\nAltogther, both are independent. \nPatch LGTM. Only one nit comment.",

      "message": "Well, I actually held back the patches originally to come up with a good name for the mechanism, but then gave up and just used what is already around and what people would intuitively understand. I agree with Manish that introducing a completely new term here is suboptimal, however fitting this term may be. So I figured that using ENABLE_FEAT_* is probably the best idea. If the \"_*\" looks odd, I can surely drop this. We could somewhat define ENABLE_FEAT as the mechanism explicitly somewhere in this file, in case people search for that.",
