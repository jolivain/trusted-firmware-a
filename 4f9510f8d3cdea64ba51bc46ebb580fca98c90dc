      "message": "I don\u0027t find this line very useful, TBH. To simplify, maybe you can use `armv8-2-a-feats` to hold only the features that belong to v8.2-a specifically, and then do `FEAT_LIST +\u003d ${armv8-2-a-feats}` instead of `FEAT_LIST :\u003d ${armv8-2-a-feats}`. This way, the code looks clearer and for each version, you don\u0027t depend on the previous one, but just add on FEAT_LIST instead.\nThe same applies for the other versions further on.",
