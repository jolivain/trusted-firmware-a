      "message": "So this is a different solution than the one discussed in https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1614, whereby Soby proposed that the kernel\u0027s execution state be passed in argument to dt_add_psci_node(). With the current solution, we cannot support the use case of an AArch64 TF-A booting a 32-bit kernel. Now, is the current thinking that this use case is so uncommon that we do not want to support it? Especially since this is for PSCI v0.1 implementation, as I understand these device tree nodes are not needed for later versions?\n\nHow was this code tested? I am guessing it\u0027s not that easy... I suppose we could set up different test configurations in the CI with different device trees, some having the right DT nodes, some without and expecting TF-A to add them, then have TFTF check the resulting device tree in memory? Do you reckon that would work?\n\nOn second thoughts, I think it would be much easier to implement unit tests (running on the host machine) targeting the DT methods in this file directly.",
