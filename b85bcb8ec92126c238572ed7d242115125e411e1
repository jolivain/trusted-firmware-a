      "message": "Analysing the CI failures, there was only one test config [1] which failed. However, the UART output looks correct to me. All PCR values got read, PRC0 !\u003d 0, PCR1 !\u003d 0, PCR[2-11] \u003d\u003d 0 as expected. LAVA concludes with \"Job finished correctly\".\n\nThe issue happens later at the post-expect script phase in Jenkins and is likely to be due to the following spurious character being emitted in the console output:\n\n NOTICE:         Digest  ï¿½     : 58 d0 fe 8c bf 6d e2 f4 ef dc 15 a0 b7 7e f0 e7\n NOTICE:  \t\t      : ce c1 c7 e7 a7 21 a3 f9 ac 68 42 da 0f 35 9f 5b\n\nThis messes up with the post-expect scripts, which expect this digest to be strictly identical with the ones generated by the fTPM service later in the test session.\n\nThese spurious characters issues have been observed randomly in other test configs and unfortunately, their cause is unknown. The same test passed on rerun [2].\n\n[1] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-builder/2132946/\n[2] https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-ci-gateway/39506/",
