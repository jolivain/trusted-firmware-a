PLM failure should be primary solved in PLM not in TF-A. If address is not passed then setting up hardcoded address can create also security concern.\n",

      "message": "Interesting chose of wording but no, you cant have it both ways: the message is as coherent as the code...it would have cost you nothing to have the code mention PLM instead of FSBL (a simple mapping). why you chose not to and now you feel that you need commit messages to reference PLM makes zero sense and in fact adds confusion.\n\nOk on the formating rules.\n\nNot sure about the security concern since the image is being validated before booting in secure mode. Please extend what you mean.",

      "message": "Sorry I am not following your description in the first paragraph. \n\nAlso can\u0027t see any reaction why PLM is not providing proper address for TEE. When PLM loads that SW it has to update that handoff structure. It means your tee-raw.bin should be placed to selected address and bl32_image_ep_info.pc already filled. If it is not the case then PLM has a bug which should be fixed.\n\nAnd regarding security concern. You use secure boot for booting system without BL32. You get to OS. You find a way how to write your SW to 0x60000000 and you do soft reboot. Then your SW will be automatically pick up from that address and run as secure OS.",

      "message": "The first paragraph is about the Versal code not referencing PLM by maintainer choice. And now being asked to reference PLM in the commit message. It is inconsistent and arbitrary.\n\nSure - I didnt think that would be a concern since if that was the case there would never be a default config for the secure world. Why is there a jump to it when the XLNX signature is corrupted.\n\nStill easy to fix - both use cases - by just making it selectable by CFG.\n\nHowever not sure if doing that since I sense some pushback. I can do it if there is interest. Otherwise I\u0027ll stop here.",

Let me explain what I have meant by my first reply.\n\"Versal is not using FSBL but only PLM.\" - Xilinx is using FSBL term only in connection to Xilinx ZynqMP family not Versal. That\u0027s why it can be confusing for readers what you are referring to.\n\n\"Subject is not following formatting rules too.\" - please read docs/process/commit-style.rst how subject line should be composed based on rules.\n\n\"PLM failure should be primary solved in PLM not in TF-A.\" PLM should provide proper structure. If structure is broken TF-A shouldn\u0027t do any action.\n\n\"Why is there a jump to it when the XLNX signature is corrupted.\" - this is a bug. If structure is corrupted there shouldn\u0027t be really any fallback. It should be just panic in all non jtag boot modes. \n\nAnd in JTAG boot mode bl31_set_default_config() is called which is setting up bl32_image_ep_info.pc and bl32_image_ep_info.spsr already.",
