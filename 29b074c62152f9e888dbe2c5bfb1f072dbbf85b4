      "message": "The message seems to suggest there is a problem in the TF-A source, while there is not. The fdt_read_uint32_array() used previously does take care of endianess.\n\nThe current patch is making it easier for the user to copy paste UUID string from tools. The Hex representation was a bit incovenient.\n\nSo it has to be made more explicit.\n\nChanging representation of DT property is a breaking change for platforms so it needs flagging up. Suggest to add a \"NOTE:\" for platform integrators to flag this commit as a breaking change.",
