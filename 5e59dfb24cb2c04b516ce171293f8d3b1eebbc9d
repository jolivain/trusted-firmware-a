      "message": "Ah, OK. A bit confused about the purpose of lib/romlib/jmptbl.i now, but I went ahead checked every commit, by building a romlib config for both Juno and FVP. This lead to the addition of (many) more required functions to the two platform jmptbl.i files, in their respective commits.\nSo every commit builds now without warnings for those two configs. Hope that settles the CI issues.",
