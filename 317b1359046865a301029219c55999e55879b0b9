      "message": "No, it does not mandate it. And FEAT_DETECTION\u003d1 with DEBUG\u003d1 would be an override-able default at best, I am definitely not having this for Allwinner.\nI think removing this is safe. Setting a feature to \"1\" now means you know what you are doing. For fixed hardware platforms this is an easy thing to do. If you are unsure, compile with FEAT_DETECTION\u003d1 *once* and see if it complains.\nIf you don\u0027t know, set it to 2, we now do all the necessary checks at runtime.",
