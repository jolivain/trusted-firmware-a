NT_FW_CONFIG shall be set to executable which will be implemented in a new patch which we yet to upstream. At the moment, since we have yet to fully done testing on silicon board (Done on Simics), thus we put it as non-executable.\n\n`NT_FW_CONFIG` is traditionally a configuration data file so it is normally **not** executable. Are you saying that eventually you will need it to be executable on your platform? Why so?\n\nWhat still confuses me is this `.next_handoff_image_id \u003d NT_FW_CONFIG_ID,` line... It is saying that after executing BL33 - which is the Linux kernel in this case, execution should be passed to `NT_FW_CONFIG_ID` - which is Linux device tree file in this case. It does not make sense to me to execute Linux device tree file, it just needs loading for the Linux kernel to find it at the appropriate location.",

      "message": "hi Sandrine, \n\nAs you mentioned, this is DTB. DTB is just a config file and ATF is just loading it into DDR. There shall be no execution needed. \n\n\nThus, currently we set this NT_FW_CONFIG_ID to non-executable and tested working on Simics platform. What we worry is once we test it on the silicon board and it required us to update to executable then we will have a new patch on it. This is what we are not sure but by right it shouldn\u0027t set to \"EXECUTABLE\".",

      "message": "I feel there is a misunderstanding here... Let me try to clarify what I have in mind.\n\nI am **not** challenging line 99, I think it\u0027s correct this way. As you said, the following lines are correctly saying that `NT_FW_CONFIG` image is **not** executable:\n\n```\n\t\t.image_id \u003d NT_FW_CONFIG_ID,\n\t\tSET_STATIC_PARAM_HEAD(ep_info, PARAM_IMAGE_BINARY,\n\t\t\tVERSION_2, entry_point_info_t,\n\t\t\tNON_SECURE | NON_EXECUTABLE),\n```\n\nThis is fine and should not be changed.\n\nHowever, line 92 (quoted below) is incorrect IMO:\n```\n\t\t.next_handoff_image_id \u003d NT_FW_CONFIG_ID,\n```\nThis is inconsistent with setting the `NT_FW_CONFIG` image as non-executable at line 99.\n\nIn summary, I think line 99 should be kept as is, but line 92 above should be changed into:\n\n```\n\t\t.next_handoff_image_id \u003d INVALID_IMAGE_ID,\n```",
