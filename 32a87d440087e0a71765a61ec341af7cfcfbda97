NT_FW_CONFIG shall be set to executable which will be implemented in a new patch which we yet to upstream. At the moment, since we have yet to fully done testing on silicon board (Done on Simics), thus we put it as non-executable.\n\n`NT_FW_CONFIG` is traditionally a configuration data file so it is normally **not** executable. Are you saying that eventually you will need it to be executable on your platform? Why so?\n\nWhat still confuses me is this `.next_handoff_image_id \u003d NT_FW_CONFIG_ID,` line... It is saying that after executing BL33 - which is the Linux kernel in this case, execution should be passed to `NT_FW_CONFIG_ID` - which is Linux device tree file in this case. It does not make sense to me to execute Linux device tree file, it just needs loading for the Linux kernel to find it at the appropriate location.",
