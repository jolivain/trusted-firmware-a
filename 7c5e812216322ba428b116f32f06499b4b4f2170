      "message": "Hello Sandrine,\n\nThanks for the review and kicking the CI on this.\n\nI\u0027ve seen the CI builds failed, but looking further into those I\u0027ve found out that:\n- Build #2453 failed with the message regarding the newly added file. I do recall that you mentioned that I can discard it.\n- Build #19868 failed for the `rcar-auto-opteed` platform which is unrelated to this patchset.\n\nI\u0027ll put the note regarding the DRAM mapping as you\u0027ve suggested as well, it does make sense.\n\nRegards,\nAndrey",
