      "message": "Hi Yann,\n\nAFAIK, BL32 \"extra1\" and \"extra2\" images only exist when BL32 is OP-TEE. Other TOS might not have these additional images. Here using an assertion means you\u0027re always expecting to have these extra images (hence using OP-TEE) on STM32MP1 platform ; if not then this would be treated as a programming error.\n\nI just wanted to check with you: is that the intended behaviour? If yes, then I am happy to approve these patches.",
