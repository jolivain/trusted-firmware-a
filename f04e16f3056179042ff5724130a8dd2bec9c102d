      "message": "So just picking this comment here exemplary, but this actually affects the whole series: I don\u0027t see anything in the PSCI spec that requires the *primary* core to issue the RESET request. I suspect the wording of \"other cores\" supports the idea that SYSTEM_RESET[2] can be issued from any core.\nFrom briefly looking over all patches, I don\u0027t see anything that actually relies on primary/secondary cores, but at least we should change the wording (everywhere) to remove that non-existing requirement.",
