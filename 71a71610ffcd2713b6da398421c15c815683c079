      "message": "Both exist, you are right about the is_feat__xx_supported() functions, but they in turn depend on a read_feat_xxx_id_field() function. Some features do not have a compile flag so they can do away with the is_feat__xx_supported() functions. There is precedent for this: read_feat_sme_fa64_id_field(). This is the intended and correct place to put these as it gives a feature library for tf-a.",
