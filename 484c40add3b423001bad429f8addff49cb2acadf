This needs doing before we can merge the present patch.\n\nHere is the current status AFAIA:\n- The FVP_TC2 model has been deployed on the CI.\n- There is a draft patch for scripts changes [1].\n- There is a companion draft patch for remapping some of the console outputs in TF-A [2].\n- Uploading updated RSS binaries to TF-A OpenCI will be the next task (not started).\n\nThus, we are making progress on this patch, although it might not be visible from this review.\n\nWhat is the timeline for upstreaming the new RD platform?\n\n[1] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/ci/tf-a-ci-scripts/+/25306\n[2] https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/25400",

It\u0027s worth noting that there are additional changes remaining from the CI perspective to ensure the smooth operation of the 11.23/17 FVP_TC2 model in the Open-CI environment. I\u0027m in discussions with all stakeholders to address this. Directly merging this patch is not advisable as it will break TF-A CI. Let me put my -1 vote on this patch to avoid accidental merge.",
