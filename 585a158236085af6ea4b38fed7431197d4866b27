      "message": "I\u0027ve tested the patch with `make [...] ARM_BL2_SP_LIST_DTS\u003d../bl2_sp_list.dtsi SP_DTS_LIST_FRAGMENT\u003d../out/bl2_sp_list.dtsi SP_LAYOUT_FILE\u003d../sp_layout.json all fip` and it worked nicely. I had to set both ARM_BL2_SP_LIST_DTS and SP_DTS_LIST_FRAGMENT to the same file, so the fvp_tb_fw_config.dts can include the generated DTS fragment.\nMy only concern is that I can\u0027t see how is it ensured that the fragment is ready when the build system processes fvp_tb_fw_config.dts. This applies to other dts files which might include ARM_BL2_SP_LIST_DTS. The fragment should be a prerequisite of target which processes the dts files.",
