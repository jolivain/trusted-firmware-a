      "message": "plat_info.remote_ddr_size cannot be negative (since it\u0027s a uint8_t) so this test can be removed.\n\nI noticed here that the local DDR size is not allowed to be zero, whereas the remote one can be. Just wanted to double-check with you that the difference is there on purpose, I am guessing the reason is that the code may deal with systems with/without remote DDR, whereas we always expect some local DDR, correct?",
