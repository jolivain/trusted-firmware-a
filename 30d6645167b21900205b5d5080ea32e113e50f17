      "message": "In my understanding CSV2_2 and CSV2_3 are both allowing us to access the same registers:\nSCXTNUM_ELx resgisters.\n\nI don\u0027t see anything additional being introduced newly under CSV2_3 feature. It confirms CSV2_2 is present.\nIn that scenario, when does this condition holds true. \nThe second part of the logic, is_feat_scv2_3_supported(), will never be executed, because the first part of the logic already reads true, when CSV2_3 is present.\n\nIn that case, do we need this additonal condition (is_feat_csv2_3_supported())) here? \nIsn\u0027t if ((is_feat_csv2_2_supported())\n{\n\t\t/* Enable access to the SCXTNUM_ELx registers. */\n\t\tscr_el3 |\u003d SCR_EnSCXT_BIT;\n}\nsufficient to cover both the cases, as the logic checks for \u003e\u003d 2 in arch_features.h\n\n\nPlease do let me know your thoughts here.\n\nThanks!",
