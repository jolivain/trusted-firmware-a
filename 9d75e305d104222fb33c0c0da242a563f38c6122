      "message": "I agree that platform can choose to implement it in whatever way it wants to, even MAX_PE_PER_CLUSTER can be defined directly instead of using MAX_CPU_PER_CLUSTER and MAX_PE_PER_CPU to calculate it.\n\nThere is no technical reason as such but it will make the code more cleaner and reusable.\n\nFor example, You do not have to define RD_N1_EDGE_MAX_PE(and similary for other platform)  at all instead you can use PLAT_CORE_COUNT(which is a standard way to define max number of PE\u0027s)\nYou can define PLAT_CORE_COUNT as  CHIP_COUNT * CLUSTER_PER_CHIP * CORE_PER_CLUSTER * PE_PER_CPU.\n\nAnother example is when you change cpu from multi-threaded to a single threaded with current code you need to modify both MAX_PE_PER_CPU as well as MAX_PE_PER_CHIP while with suggested change you just need to modify MAX_PE_PER_CPU.\n\nPlease let me know the reason why you need CSS_SGI_MAX_PE_PER_CHIP? does it solves any special purpose ??",
