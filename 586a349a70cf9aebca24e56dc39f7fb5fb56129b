Is this intentional? \nI believe the python script should check if all appropriate BL binaries are available and report an error if any binary is missing. The user can then build using the appropriate build flags.",

      "message": "I add this dependency to be sure that the tools is called after the build of the bl images.\nThe intentional use for this target is to simply add it as part of a make command:\n`make PLAT\u003dfvp ... DEBUG\u003d1 memmap`\n\nThe advantage of this is that make can provide the build directory to the python script. This allows to keep the python script really simple: It doesn\u0027t have to find the binaries inside the build/xx/yy directory.\n\nI\u0027m not really familiar with this makefile, and would gladly modify this if you have a proper way of doing it !",
