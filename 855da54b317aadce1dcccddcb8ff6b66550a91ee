My personal view is that its not immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the code base what is being modified below.\n\n    \tin_vec[2].len--;\n\nI can see we are modifying something in the log measurement but what exactly? Moreover, were the log measurement structure to change for whatever reason, I\u0027m not sure it would be apparent that this needs changing. My suggestion would be to modify version_size itself before defining the log measurement. This is a minor point of-course, so feel free to ignore.",
