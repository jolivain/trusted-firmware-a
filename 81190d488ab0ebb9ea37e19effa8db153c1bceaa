      "message": "Yes, Madhu. \nI believe it\u0027s safe to ensure and update the community that we have tried and tested our Code till the version we have in our CI. Sometimes there will be beta versions in the Arm Developer Site, and between the release cycle, (6-month window), there are chances, that there could be a higher version of the toolchain. \nEspecially during the last release cycle, a few of the toolchain updates insisted we modify a few bits in our Makefile/Build system. \nHenceforth, this time, I thoroughly tested the toolchain (12.3) in staging and then pushed these patches intended for production.\nI thought in this way and hence changed it. Let me know your thoughts here. I will proceed accordingly.",

But if we state it as \u003e\u003d, we aren\u0027t sure regarding what the future updates in GCC. I agree that GCC  will remain compatible with the earlier versions. But during last release while updating from 11.3 to 12.2, we did encounter some build issues due to toolchain upgrade, wherein we resolved later.\nTaking this into consideration, I felt it would be good and safe to state as \u003c\u003d.\n\n \"I\u0027m not sure I agree with the \u003c\u003d here, we make no guarantees that we support a version of GCC prior to the one we use to test in the CI \"\n \n \u003e So does this mean, our current code base, isn\u0027t compatible with older versions of GCC ? I thought the other way as every release we do, we get updates without affecting older ones.\n \n Let me know your thoughts here.",
