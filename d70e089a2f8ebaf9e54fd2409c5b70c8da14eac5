      "message": "This is the exact same code as in bl31_platform_setup(), suggest moving it to a new function fvp_timer_init() in plat/arm/board/fvp/fvp_common.c, called from both bl1_platform_setup() and bl31_platform_setup().\n\nbl2_platform_setup() could also make use of it, although I notice one difference in this case: it does not enable the system-level generic timer. Do you know why? Why do we need to do it in BL1/BL31 but not in BL2?",
