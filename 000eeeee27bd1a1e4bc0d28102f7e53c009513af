I don\u0027t see any specific toolchain version specified in the instructions on [1]. I\u0027ve found a mention of GCC 6.2 on this page [2] but these are FVP-specific instructions, they might advise a different version for other platforms.\n\nBottom line, I think we cannot rely on these instructions to indicate the toolchain version for the time being and we should indicate the exact version we use.\n\n[1] https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/arm/arm-reference-platforms.git/about/\n[2] https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/arm/arm-reference-platforms.git/about/docs/basefvp/user-guide.rst",

But I think the statments above this sentence indicate that the user needs to download and install the cross-toolchain. The way I understood this sentence was that if the user wants to use older linaro releases, they can look at the older release notes to see which version of GCC was used.",

      "message": "Actually, the script downloads the cross-compiler (GCC 6.2) if I choose to build from source. I think this statement is confusing because it gives the impression that Linaro also provides the cross compiler, which is not necessarily true for newer versions of GCC. I made some changes in the second patch set which should make things clearer. Let me know if it makes sense. Thanks.",
