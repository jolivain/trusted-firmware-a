      "message": "Hi @Madhukar,\nThere are several things reported there.\nFirst, the copyright dates in the DT files: I\u0027d prefer keeping them as-is, as those files are mainly copied from Linux. Adding 2021 will add another difference in the files.\nSecond the checkpatch errors: those seems like false issues, the \u0027return -EIO;\u0027 looks perfectly valid. Same for other issues I think. Has the checkpatch version changed, or is there something we should configure?\nThe other warning comes from an fvp_r patch.\n\nBest regards,\nYann",

      "message": "Hi Yann\n\nIf I am not mistaken, the issue is with inconsistent spacing in the files (ex: plat/st/common/stm32cubeprogrammer_usb.c). I have rarely seen these kinds of errors being reported by static check scripts.\nIn line 111, there is 1 space between \"return\" and \"-EIO\". However, it looks like there are 2 spaces between them in line 119.\n\nCan you please push a patch to fix it? We will run CI tests to see if it fixes the issue.",
