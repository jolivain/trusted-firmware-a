I found some traces of super convoluted code in some BSP code base to figure out some kind of die revision, but even in the best case there were just two different revisions.\nI don\u0027t know how much we really care about those minor revisions, I was wondering if we should introduce them only if there is a real need? So far it seems that this A64 revision register is RES0 for the other SoCs, so I consider this little harm for now.",
