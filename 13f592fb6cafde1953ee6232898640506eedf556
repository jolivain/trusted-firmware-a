      "message": "Nit: You may want to consider saying why (ie we recommend experimental feature are not used in production build and the build system signals that with build time messages).  I also appreciate we don\u0027t call this out the generic threat model and also no where in the documentation do we fully define what experimental means that I could find so maybe a bigger issue which we don\u0027t want to address with this change. Various features have their own guidance when marked experimental. See search https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search.html?q\u003dExperimental\u0026check_keywords\u003dyes\u0026area\u003ddefault.\n\n\n\nAlso RME is marked as Experimental currently I assume we are removing this? https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/realm-management-extension.html#three-world-execution",

New threats identified in this threat model will only be given a risk rating for this environment. Other environments may be added in a future revision.\"?",
