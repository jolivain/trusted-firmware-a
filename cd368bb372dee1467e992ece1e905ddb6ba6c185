I have merely done a build test, checking that the build succeeded with the following command line:\n\n    make CROSS_COMPILE\u003daarch64-none-elf- PLAT\u003dnpcm845x SPD\u003dopteed\n    \nand the CI tests won\u0027t do much more. It could be good to run more thorough tests at your end on the platform itself.",
