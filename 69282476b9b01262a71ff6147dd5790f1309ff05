      "message": "This code becomes really hard to read with all these new preprocessor directives IMO. I think it might be time to rework this file. We could have the BL1 chain of trust defined in a file (say bl1_tbbr_cot.c) and the BL2 CoT defined in another one (say bl2_tbbr_cot.c). Some of the buffers in this file are used by both CoTs so we\u0027ll probably need a third file for that.\n\nOnce we\u0027ve got this cleaned up, we can look at adding the support for this new TBBR_COT_DESC_IN_DTB on top of it. I think it might be more manageable this way.\n\nHow does that sound?",
