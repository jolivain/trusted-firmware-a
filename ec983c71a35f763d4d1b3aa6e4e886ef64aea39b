      "message": "I think the script should be updated.\n\nEspecially regarding dt-bindings header files. Looking into Linux kernel v5.5 source tree, over 465 header files found in include/dt-bindings/, 34 are GPLv2.0(+) OR MIT, 2 are GPLv2.0(+) OR BSD-2-Clause and 11 are GPLv2.0(+) OR BSD-2-Clause.\nSuch header files are generic and TF-A should not impose a specific license as soon as the license model complies with TF-A licensing model, which MIT and BSD-2-Clause license models do.\n\nThat said, maybe this specific st,stm32-etzpc.h could be released under GPLv2.0+ OR BSD-3-Clause.\n@Yann Gautier, your opinion on this?",
