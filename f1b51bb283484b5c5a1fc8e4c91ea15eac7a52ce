      "message": "Ah - yes, that\u0027s a good point, we have no guarantees that x9 contains the link register when we restore it. We have a couple of options to deal with this: conditionally restore the link register at the end of the errata sequence if `get_rev \u003d\u003d 1`; or, unconditionally cache the register in x9 at the start of the function. What do you think?",
