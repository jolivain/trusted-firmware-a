      "message": "That is a good point, there was a mistake in how this was being handled. We had been zeroing all the register only if this entry is supplied (after previously populating the core ID).\nI think the correct behavior here would be to first zero all the registers and then populate individual registers as required rather than leave any existing values. Does this seem reasonable?",
