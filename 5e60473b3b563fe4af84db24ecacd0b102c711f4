      "message": "no point in having both the assert and the if (confing_info !\u003d NULL). assert usually means that it should never happen. If statements mean that it can happen sometimes. If you are sure it should never happen, an assert will suffice. If you think it can happen sometimes, it should be an if, and the else should handle the case where it is NULL, perhaps return an error or panic.",

      "message": "Sorry. i dont agree with this here. see https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-guidelines.html#using-assert-to-check-for-programming-errors. \nWhat this code is telling a reader is that i expect this to never happen(assert) and then the code goes ahead and checks it anyway and that tells the reader it can happen. I cant think of a reason why both should exist. You have one or the other. Either you assert in debug builds that it never happens, or you take the approach that it may happen in both debug and release builds.",
