      "message": "The documentation in this file is concerned with the lower levels of the cryptographic library. It documents build options that drive the configuration of mbedTLS, i.e. TF_MBEDTLS_KEY_ALG and TF_MBEDTLS_KEY_SIZE. It doesn\u0027t refer to the higher-level options like KEY_ALG and KEY_SIZE. Similarly, I think it is not the right place to refer to DECRYPTION_SUPPORT. I think it would be more appropriate to document TF_MBEDTLS_USE_AES_GCM here.\n\nI suggest replacing this paragraph with something along these lines:\n\n -  ``TF_MBEDTLS_USE_AES_GCM`` enables the authenticated decryption support based on\n    AES-GCM algorithm. Valid values are 0 and 1.",
