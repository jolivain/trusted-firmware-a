      "message": "So looking at the failures in the OpenCI and the Legacy CI I think given the changes are in the Trusty SPD and in platform code that for the majority of the test failures they are nothing to do with your changes.\n\nHowever there is some failures in the Static analysis tests https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-static-checks/2645/\n\n****** Order of includes on the last patch(es) ******\n\nResult : FAILURE\n\nChecking files modified between patches origin/master and HEAD...\n\nbe998f829::plat/xilinx/common/ipi_mailbox_service/ipi_mailbox_svc.c:\nInclude ordering error, order should be:\n\t#include \"../../../services/spd/trusty/include/trusty/smcall.h\"\n\t#include \u003clib/mmio.h\u003e\n\n\t#include \u003cipi.h\u003e\n\t#include \"ipi_mailbox_svc.h\"\n\nPlease refer to the docs for further information on include statement ordering: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-style.html#include-statement-ordering.\n\nand. ****** Newly added files detection check for Coverity Scan analysis on patch(es) ******\n\nResult : FAILURE\n\n\nNew source files have been identified in your patch..\nplat/qemu/common/trusty_shared_mem.c\nservices/spd/trusty/shared-mem-smcall.c\n\n1. Kindly ensure these newly added source files are covered by : \n   a. Coverity scan analysis by adding them to \"tf-cov-make\" build script with the appropriate build configurations. \n   b. Built as part of one of the platform configurations present in \"tf-l1-build-plat\" test group.\n\n   Please refer to the tf-a documentation for more detailed explanation. \n   \"https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html#add-build-configurations\"\n\n2. Please ignore if your files are already updated. Further the Code Maintainer will \n   resolve the issue by taking appropriate action.\n\nBeside the above there are quite a few WARNINGS in the above Static analysis test log that you may want to look at.\n\nHTH\n\n",
