      "message": "Please see the commit message. This is also what I\u0027m trying to do with this patch stack. Yes, it\u0027s harmless, but it is also extremely convoluted and makes it hard to track down tf-a\u0027s running context. I try to clean all of this up in a consistent manner across all features so that feature flags actually do what they\u0027re advertised to do.\n\nThis also removes some complexity as it\u0027s easier to do in C.",
