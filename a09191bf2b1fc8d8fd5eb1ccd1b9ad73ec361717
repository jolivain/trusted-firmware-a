      "message": "I wonder if we could leverage the ARM_BL2_SP_LIST_DTS option recently introduced. This would make this process of adding a new partition a bit more scalable. This permits injects DT fragments rather than modifying a single monolithic dts.\nSecondly, I was thinking of just re-purposing the 4th partition (presently shim based) to be VHE based. On the other hand this drops testing the legacy shim approach. Needs more thought.",

I dont think shim approach will go away in the near future so there is value in having that type of test...and let me explore ARM_BL2_SP_LIST_DTS little more and see if i can clean it up.",
