Rephrasing what is in the spec can lead to further confusion.. this hsould only talk about the IMPDEF details?\nwhat do you think? I\u0027m okay as is, but it seems like this will be troublesome if there is conflicting info here and in the spec or one or the other is not updated in sync (Coherency issues ;))..",
