If not, should we consider adding them instead of guarding like this.\nI can see the default value for RESET_TO_BL2 here [1]. It might be the same case for EL3_PAYLOAD_BASE. I don\u0027t believe it gets defined initially unless we provide this build option via the command line. Please double check on this.\n\n[1]: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/make_helpers/defaults.mk#n33.",
