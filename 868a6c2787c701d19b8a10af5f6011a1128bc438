      "message": "Perhaps this is off topic and should be addressed in a separate patch: at line 171, policy is declared as a pointer to a *const* struct but then here at lines 183-184, we are returning pointers to some its fields, allowing the caller to modify them. This breaks the \"const contract\". I think we should remove the const qualifier at line 171.",
