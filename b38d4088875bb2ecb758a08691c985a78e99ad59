      "message": "We could maybe leave that disabled by default? The reason is that, for the erratum to occur, CPUECTLR_EL1.HPA_CAP bit must be enabled. Since this bit\u0027s value out of reset is zero, I would think that it\u0027s the platform\u0027s responsibility to enable this workaround, if HPA_CAP is indeed enabled. I don\u0027t know where this bit is set, potentially it\u0027s part of the MMU initialisation...?\n\nAlso, since the workaround mentions a small performance impact, maybe it\u0027s another reason to leave it disabled by default?\n\nDon\u0027t change it only because of my comment, though. It\u0027s better to cross-check.",
