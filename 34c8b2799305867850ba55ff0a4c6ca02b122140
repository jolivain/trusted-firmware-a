So far it wasn\u0027t a problem to enable the rail if DRIVEVBUS is just mentioned in the DT. If this now isn\u0027t good enough anymore, we might now dig deeper into the DT to cover all cases.",

It doesn\u0027t mean that the regulator should be turned on at boot, or ever.\n\nIf setting the value of DRIVEVBUS is really necessary, it should be based on the regulator, not the pinmux property (either using the existing should_enable_regulator() logic, or a specific property, such as regulator-boot-on).",
