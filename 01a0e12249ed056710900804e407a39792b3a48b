      "message": "Hi,\n\nCould you describe a bit more the use case where you see the issue?\nI agree having this data in the stack is not very good here.\nBut my idea is that this data should be in platform code, like what is done in plat/rpi/rpi3/rpi3_bl2_setup.c. But it means modifying several platforms (hikey, poplar, agilex, stratix10, imx7, st). Let me check that.\nWhat platform do you use?\n\nFor the runtime part, all upstream platforms using MMC framework compile this only for BL1 and/or BL2.\nAnd those stages are used for boot, not for platform runtime.\nBut maybe you use another config/platform?\n\nRegards,\nYann",
