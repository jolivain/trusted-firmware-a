      "message": "I created this DT a while ago, originally just for using it on the Linux kernel. To make it easier to move this later to the kernel (or some related) repo, I kept the GPL license, just added BSD to make it TF-A compatible.\nThe DT is a hardware description, and really not at all TF specific. I just put it in the repo for convenience reasons. So dual licensing should give the most freedom in using it wherever we want.\nSome DTs in the TF-A repo and many DTs in the kernel use this same approach, for similar reasons.",
