      "message": "Just explaining my thoughts behind it: \n\nFor example, as part of feature detection mechanism, we enable features based on arch_version to verify their presence. So we will definitely use this function if in case we want to detect FEAT_PACQARMA,in future. \n\nAssume we are building TF-A for arch MAJOR\u003d8 and MINOR\u003d3, so in this case all the features till v8.3 get enabled and will be detected in feature detection mechanism. If in case we keep 8_8 naming, it will be confusing at later part. So keeping it as 8_3 will be safe and eliminates this confusion in my understanding.",
