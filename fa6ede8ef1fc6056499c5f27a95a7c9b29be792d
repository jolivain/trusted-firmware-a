      "message": "This function is used on the Neoverse-N1 library and also needed for the N2 library. I thought of moving it here rather than having two copies of the same function on different files.\n\nThe same applies to CPUCFR_EL1 register you mention on your other comment. It is specific to Neoverse cores but if I want to have a common function I need to move the register definition to a common header.\n\nThe alternative would be to move this function (or to embed its code) to each one of the Neoverse libraries.\n\nI\u0027m ok with that if you think it is a better approach.",
