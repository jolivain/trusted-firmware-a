      "message": "This function is used on the Neoverse-N1 library and also needed for the N2 library. I thought of moving it here rather than having two copies of the same function on different files.\n\nThe same applies to CPUCFR_EL1 register you mention on your other comment. It is specific to Neoverse cores but if I want to have a common function I need to move the register definition to a common header.\n\nThe alternative would be to move this function (or to embed its code) to each one of the Neoverse libraries.\n\nI\u0027m ok with that if you think it is a better approach.",

      "message": "As this is Neoverse Nx CPU specific register with specific SCU and ECC bit fields (e.g Neoverse E1 also has this this register but no SCU field) which is not present in other CPUs, it would be better to move this definitions in a common neoverse_n or neoverse.h header file because arch.h should only have definitions commmon to Arm archtecture.",
