As per the Arm Arm docs  here: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/ja\n0x2 is the value supported other values are reserved.\n\nHAFDBS, bits [3:0]\nHardware updates to Access flag and Dirty state in translation tables. Defined values are:\n0b0000  Hardware update of the Access flag and dirty state are not supported.\n0b0001  Support for hardware update of the Access flag for Block and Page descriptors.\n0b0010  As 0b0001, and adds support for hardware update of the Access flag for Block and Page\ndescriptors. Hardware update of dirty state is supported.\nAll other values are reserved.\nFEAT_HAFDBS implements the functionality identified by the values 0b0001 and 0b0010.\n\nSo it should be 0x2 right? or am I referrring to an old doc ?\nlet me know your thoughts here.",

Looks like the latest Arm ARM document is not in sync with these details. \nSo agree with your change. \n\nWith respect to the naming, I opted to shorten it similar to: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/22134/3/include/arch/aarch64/arch.h#289. The other values are not as easily abbreviated and was concerned we might end up with overly verbose names for the values.\n\n\u003e Ok. \nWe dont have a standard template/naming convention here, which is a concerning factor.\nSince majority of the features were following the naming convention ( 299 to 346) mentioned the same.\nWould have been nice if followed this pattern.
