      "message": "That\u0027s in docs/plat/qemu.rst, and I was referring to this \"To build flash.bin\" section: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plat/qemu.html#booting-via-flash-based-firmwares\n\nNow I see that the normal build (make PLAT\u003dqemu all) does not create a FIP image, and does not require specifying a BL33, hence the CI build failures.\n\nJens, can you tell what the expected \"normal\" use case is? The platform doc speaks of using semihosting, is that really something people do? I was expecting that TF-A would be combined with either U-Boot or EDK-2, and that all the firmware bits are contained in one .rom file. But so far most CI job seem to not use that.",

I didn\u0027t really want to change the default anyway.\nI think there are some users of the combined ROM file feature as well, so I am leaning towards either protecting the new make targets with \"ifneq (${BL33},)\", or adding a new pseudo build target, like \"rom\".",
