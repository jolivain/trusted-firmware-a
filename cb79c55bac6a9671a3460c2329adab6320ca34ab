      "message": "Additionally, I\u0027m considering whether it would be useful to validate the transfer list before deploying it to the system. For example, instead of directly adding or removing entries, we could use a standalone transfer list that can be validated before deployment. This tool could perform such validations, with a command like for example ``tl validate tl.bin``. I\u0027m not certain if this is a common practical, though.",

At first glance, I’m uncertain about the feasibility of this idea. However, if you could provide more details, it would help me better understand the use case you’re envisioning.",
