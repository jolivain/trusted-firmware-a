      "message": "Additionally, I\u0027m considering whether it would be useful to validate the transfer list before deploying it to the system. For example, instead of directly adding or removing entries, we could use a standalone transfer list that can be validated before deployment. This tool could perform such validations, with a command like for example ``tl validate tl.bin``. I\u0027m not certain if this is a common practical, though.",
