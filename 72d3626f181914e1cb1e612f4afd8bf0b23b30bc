In rest of the BLs, this function gets called from populate framework.\n\nAs it is direct call from BL1, we thought changing its name to populate_dtb_registry.",

The prefix helps identify the module it belongs to(for ex all xlat_table functions are usually prefixed with xlat_table). I\u0027m fine either way with a slight preference to leave it as is.",
