      "message": "Some improvements that can be made :\n\n1. The double fault handling logic need to be reviewed and possibly removed (since the outcome for EL3 is the same). The per CPU storage of ESR can be removed and only SAVED_ESR needs to be present. We need another mechanism to detect re-entrancy into EL3, see point 3.\n\n2. The Context storage for new variables can be replaced with per-CPU storage (thus saving the storage for per world).\n\n3. The nested EA count could be a per-CPU variable which keeps track of number of times EL2 is re-entered. Typically we allow only one re-entrancy for nested faults and 2 for SDEI. This will help to harden the EL3 firmware against unbounded re-entrancy which is detected on an adhoc mechanism.\n\nIf you can raise tasks for them and pick them as we go along.",
