      "message": "Since this is the only use case for this API for now I think we should just update the existing API rather than add a second one. The new API you\u0027re adding can do everything the old one did (by just using size 0) and more, so there\u0027s no point in having both.\n\nI\u0027d just make this coreboot_get_memory_type(address, size) to not make the name too long. (I\u0027d also suggest passing size instead of end_address, I think that\u0027s more natural.)",
