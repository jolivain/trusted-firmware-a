      "message": "Further optimization is possible (need not be part of Andre\u0027s refactor). \n\nCurrently allocation of space in CPU Context is dependant on CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS. So even if ENABLE_FEAT_FGT\u003d0 but CTX_INCLUDE_EL2_REGS\u003d1, we still allocate space in the CPU context which is wasteful.\n\n\nIf this can  be a made separate C data structure and can be accessed as a regular C object here (we dont need fancy write_ctx_regs as it is a C data structure), then the linker will take care removing the allocated space if they are not referenced during the compilation. This will save space in EL3 firmware.\n\n@Jayanth, could you capture this as a JIRA to be followed up later ?",
