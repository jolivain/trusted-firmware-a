      "message": "The guidelines, are \n1. If you change the Copy right Year, you should keep the original year, \"2017-21\"\n2. Its better to change copyright year only if you are doing a major rework, if its a small fix(like this) then you can safely ignore it.\n\nSo, for your patch you should be alright with leaving it as original one or changing it to 2017-21. (but you can\u0027t have 2021 which means the file is created in 2021).\nSorry for confusion, but once you do it, your patches should be ready to be merged.",
