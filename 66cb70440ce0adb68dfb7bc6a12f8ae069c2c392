We think that it is more flexible and good enough to mandate that the code compiles at the patch series granularity.\n\nThis, in turn, requires maintainers to merge patch series atomically, as a single chunk, and refrain from merging part of it, at least in the cases where such build errors occur in the middle the patch stack.",

Unfortunately, as you know, only Arm developers have access to most of the CI results right now and so we usually take a look at the results on behalf of other contributors and explicitly ask them to fix any such issue. But when the CI has fully transitioned to tf.org, we would like patch authors to take care of it by themselves, hence this sentence.\n\nI think it does not harm to say it explicitly.
