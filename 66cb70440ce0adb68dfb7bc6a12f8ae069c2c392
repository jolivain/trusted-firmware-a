Indeed, I\u0027ve read the DCO again [1] and I now realize that it\u0027s not necessarily about authorship, in particular in the situation of (c) in [1]. From there, I guess the sentence \"The names in the ``Signed-off-by:`` and ``Author:`` lines must match.\" is wrong and should be removed.\n\nI am tempted to make this paragraph shorter and just point people at the DCO. Something like:\n\n Ensure that each commit in the series has at least one ``Signed-off-by:`` line,\n using the individual\u0027s real name and email address. By adding this line the\n contributor certifies the contribution is made under the terms of the DCO.\n\n More details may be found in the `Gerrit Signed-off-by Lines guidelines`_.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\n[1] https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/dco.txt",

In addition to breaking Git expectations, it\u0027s also just odd for reviewers to approve a patch when there\u0027s clearly an important part missing from it that is only added in a later patch. One of the main reasons for breaking changes up into smaller patches is that they can be reviewed one at a time, but that doesn\u0027t work if the patch isn\u0027t actually self-contained.\n\nI\u0027d be curious to hear about the concerns that were raised about this within Arm in detail.

I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever faced a situation where I could not make a patch compile in a series.\n\nJulius, unfortunately I don\u0027t recall all the details but I believe there has been situations in the past were the contributor was struggling to get all patches in their series to compile. Rather than addressing the problem (by splitting the patches in another manner or using one of the techniques Andre mentioned, which would have required some more work when the patch series as a whole was already complete), we deemed that it was OK to assume that people would not cherry-pick individual patches in the series and would instead get the whole feature, as all patches were necessary to get a fully working solution anyway.\n\nClearly you guys disagree with this approach for different reasons (fair ones IMO!) so I am happy with revising that and mandate here that every patch must compile and enforce that more strictly in the CI.\n\nThis is where I can see that formalizing the implicit rules in this patch is a useful thing! It triggers interesting discussions.\n\nI\u0027ll wait for another couple of days, see if anyone has a different opinion on this.

Tegra patches almost always lie on gerrit without any reviews.\n\nIs that even when you explicitly assign the review to specific people? If yes, perhaps you happen to choose the same ones too often, which overloads them too much and they can\u0027t cope with all the reviews? Also, how long do you wait before considering that the patch is lying without any reviews? Review timelines/delays is something we haven\u0027t discussed yet so different people might have a different frame of reference for this.\n\nI am just trying to identify the reasons why we end up in this situation. I would really like to mandate that each and every patch gets reviewed by someone else, this seems very important to me.\n\n\u003e I think one of the objectives of this exercise should also be to alleviate the pain of the code submitters and get patches merged quickly.
