      "message": "Looking at the CI results, it looks like BL2 no longer fits in its Trusted SRAM budget, it is short of 1 page. Could you please investigate why? What is pushing us above the limit? Is it extra code pulled for P-384 keys support? Or is it because some data structures have grown? Or something else?\n\nFYI I think you can probably get some answers from TF-A memory layout tool [1], by comparing its output with and without this patch series. Probably the --footprint option is best suited for that job.\n\nThen we\u0027ll need another patch to increase this limit.\n\n[1] https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/memory-layout-tool.html",
