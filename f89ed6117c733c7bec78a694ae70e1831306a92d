      "message": "Thanks. Fair enough, makes sense. This is one reason why i suggested earlier that we fold this into auth_img_desc_t. You cannot use this feature without TBBR and TBBR requires the COT. You could add an auth method, that calls crypto_mod_auth_decrypt. TBBR and encryption are coupled anyway in your design. Something to consider.",
