      "message": "NRD1 is an exception where we have 3 different CSS versions coming underneath it. I have filtered out configs that remained similar for these platforms into the platform port file (trusted firmware required macros).\n\nAs you said, they would be using the same power level and system power domain (as they have been using now). If at all, we have a case where one of them needs a different value, these macros would have to be moved out to the respective platform_def.h file (although I don\u0027t anticipate any functionality change to these platforms at this point)\n\nStarting from NRD2 - its mostly 1 type of platform and its variants coming under the version, so we shouldn\u0027t have this problem.",
