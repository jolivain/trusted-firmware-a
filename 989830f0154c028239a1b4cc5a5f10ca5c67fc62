      "message": "I see that, in this patch, you have provided function definitions for few helper functions like gicd_set_icenabler which were originally defined in drivers/arm/gic/common/gic_common.c file. This essentially means that gic_common.c doesn\u0027t have common utilities shared between GICv2 and GICv3. I am of the opinion that the file gic_common.c should be renamed to something like gicd_v2_helpers.c. Let me know your thoughts.",

      "message": "Yes, you are right. But changing name of gic_common.c to gicd_v2_helpers.c will require modifications in 30 platforms\u0027 makefiles. Which can be also done by introducing new gicv2.mk file as for gicv3.mk in the merged patch. This change must also be announced in TF.org mailing list \u0026 approved by other platforms\u0027 maintainers.\nThis change should be done in the separate patch but not in that one.",
