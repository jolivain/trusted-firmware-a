      "message": "I see that, in this patch, you have provided function definitions for few helper functions like gicd_set_icenabler which were originally defined in drivers/arm/gic/common/gic_common.c file. This essentially means that gic_common.c doesn\u0027t have common utilities shared between GICv2 and GICv3. I am of the opinion that the file gic_common.c should be renamed to something like gicd_v2_helpers.c. Let me know your thoughts.",
