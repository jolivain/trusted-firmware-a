      "message": "Right yes, now you mention it that was one of the reasons behind the previous implementation. It involved more duplication of code however by populating the descriptor directly in the RX buffer it avoided the additional memory array. \nI guess for now this slightly cleaner implementation should be ok otherwise worst case we could always revert back to the previous version?",
