Could you please confirm whether the doc is indeed wrong/out-dated and fix it if needed?",

It doesn\u0027t sound like a good idea to me to parse device trees with the MMU off (and thus caches off), this is likely to be very slow... Could we delay this and move this code later in the boot flow?",

We need to do changes in both BL2 and Bl31. Are you seeing any harm apart from cache stuff to retain this call as it is now?",
