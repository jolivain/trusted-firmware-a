That\u0027s why it could be static, and there is a warning from sparse tool.\n\nWhen I re-read the MISRA report, it is not very clear if the patch adds a MISRA violation or resoles one. Especially the resolved issues page (https://ci-builds.trustedfirmware.org/static-files/FMubbFD0X5l5AfT-fOyL5WoSPj65bQGnJrzrRB3yj4AxNjcwNDg4MDYwMzg3Ojk6YW5vbnltb3VzOmpvYi90Zi1hLWVjbGFpci1kZWx0YS9URl9DT05GSUc9ZnZwLWRlZmF1bHQsbGFiZWw9ZG9ja2VyLXRmLWEtZWNsYWlyLzMyNS9hcnRpZmFjdA\u003d\u003d/resolved_issues_html/by_service.html#first_file/service\u0026kind) showing lines in red.\n@Paul, could you give us some advice about this?\n\nThanks,\nYann",
